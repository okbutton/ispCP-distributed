	# cp -f ./courier*.rpm /usr/local/
	# cd /usr/local/

	# wget http://www.thatfleminggent.com/packages/fedora/7/i386/courier-authlib-0.59.3-1.fc7.mf.i386.rpm
	# wget http://www.thatfleminggent.com/packages/fedora/7/i386/courier-authlib-userdb-0.59.3-1.fc7.mf.i386.rpm
	# wget http://www.thatfleminggent.com/packages/fedora/7/i386/courier-imap-4.1.3-1.fc7.mf.i386.rpm

	# rpm -i courier-authlib-0.59.3-1.fc7.mf.i386.rpm
	# rpm -i courier-authlib-userdb-0.59.3-1.fc7.mf.i386.rpm
	# rpm -i courier-imap-4.1.3-1.fc7.mf.i386.rpm

	Create group and user with 3000 UID so ispCP doesn't cause conflicts with user
	# groupadd courier -g 3000
	# useradd -u 3000 -c 'Courier Mail Server' -d /dev/null -g courier -s /bin/false courier

6. Build the System by using make:
	# make -f Makefile.fedora install

6. Copy all the directories into your system (you may make backups)
	# cp -RLf /tmp/ispcp/* /

7. Bind setup
	# mv /var/named/data /var/named/data2
	# ln -s /var/named/chroot/var/named/data /var/named/data

	# mkdir /var/www/scoreboards
	# touch /etc/sasldb2

8. Additional apache setup
	# echo 'include vhosts/*.conf' >> /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

	# mkdir -p /var/spool/postfix/etc
	# cp /etc/sasldb2 /var/spool/postfix/etc/sasldb2

	# chown apache:apache /var/www/ispcp/gui/tools/webmail/data

9. Now it's time to set up the frontend. Change into the engine directory:
	# cd /var/www/ispcp/engine/setup

9a. Set the MySQL password, if not set:
	# mysqladmin -u root password YOUR_PASSWORD

10. Start the engine setup:
	# perl ispcp-setup
	(Be careful: the file /etc/named.conf must exist before you run the script.
	Otherwise setup will failed on trying to backup it!
	You can use the caching-nameserver package or the system-config-bind tool
	for create it or you can use touch!)

11. Install ispCP ω step-by-step

	If you get no error, all went good; if you get one, look at
	http://isp-control.net to solve the problem.

12. There is an error in some courier-versions. Courier won't stop, if you use
	/etc/init.d/courier-authdaemon stop, so change it:
	# nano /etc/ini.d/courier-authdaemon

	change: ${libexecdir}/authlib/authdaemon stop
	into:	killall authdaemond.plain

13. Modify some system values:

	* create sasl2 database:
	# touch /etc/sasldb2

	* Install Daemon:
	# chmod +x /etc/init.d/ispcp
	# chkconfig --add ispcp
	# service ispcp start

14. Clean the temporary folders:
	# rm -R /tmp/ispcp
