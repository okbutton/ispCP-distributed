2. Change to the newly created directory:
	# cd ./ispcp-omega-1.0.5

3. Install the required modules from 'fedora-packages'
	# wget http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/epel/5/ARCH/epel-release-5-3.noarch.rpm
	# rpm -Uvh epel-release-5-3.noarch.rpm
	# yum install `cat ./docs/Fedora/fedora-packages`

	# cpan2rpm -i http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/P/PH/PHOENIX/Term-ReadPassword-0.07.tar.gz
	# wget -P /tmp/core http://hany.sk/mirror/fedora/releases/7/Everything/i386/os/Fedora/perl-Net-LibIDN-0.09-3.fc7.i386.rpm
	# rpm -i /tmp/core/perl-Net-LibIDN-0.09-3.fc7.i386.rpm

4. (optional) Check the ispcp.conf and adapt it to your requirements.

5. Install Courier
	# cp -f ./courier*.rpm /usr/local/
	# cd /usr/local/

	# wget http://www.thatfleminggent.com/packages/fedora/7/i386/courier-authlib-0.59.3-1.fc7.mf.i386.rpm
	# wget http://www.thatfleminggent.com/packages/fedora/7/i386/courier-authlib-userdb-0.59.3-1.fc7.mf.i386.rpm
	# wget http://www.thatfleminggent.com/packages/fedora/7/i386/courier-imap-4.1.3-1.fc7.mf.i386.rpm

	# rpm -i courier-authlib-0.59.3-1.fc7.mf.i386.rpm
	# rpm -i courier-authlib-userdb-0.59.3-1.fc7.mf.i386.rpm
	# rpm -i courier-imap-4.1.3-1.fc7.mf.i386.rpm

	Create group and user with 3000 UID so ispCP doesn't cause conflicts with user
	# groupadd courier -g 3000
	# useradd -u 3000 -c 'Courier Mail Server' -d /dev/null -g courier -s /bin/false courier

6. Build the System by using make:
	# make -f Makefile.fedora install

6. Copy all the directories into your system (you may make backups)
	# cp -RLf /tmp/ispcp/* /
	# cp -Rv /tmp/ispcp/etc/init.d /etc/rc.d/
	# ln -s /etc/rc.d/init.d /etc/init.d

	# mkdir /var/mail/virtual

7. Bind setup
	# mv /var/named/data /var/named/data2
	# ln -s /var/named/chroot/var/named/data /var/named/data

	# mkdir /var/www/scoreboards

	* create sasl2 database:
	# touch /etc/sasldb2

8. Additional apache setup
	# echo 'include vhosts/*.conf' >> /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

	# mkdir -p /var/spool/postfix/etc
	# cp /etc/sasldb2 /var/spool/postfix/etc/sasldb2

	# chown apache:apache /var/www/ispcp/gui/tools/webmail/data

9. Now it's time to set up the frontend. Change into the engine directory:
	# cd /var/www/ispcp/engine/setup

9a. Set the MySQL password, if not set:
	# mysqladmin -u root password YOUR_PASSWORD

10. Start the engine setup:
	# perl ispcp-setup
	(Be careful: the file /etc/named.conf must exist before you run the script.
	Otherwise setup will failed on trying to backup it!
	You can use the caching-nameserver package or the system-config-bind tool
	for create it or you can use touch!)

	If you get no error, all went good; if you get one, look at
