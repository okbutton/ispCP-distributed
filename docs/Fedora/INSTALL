   You have to set up some configuration variables for your linux distribution.
   ispCP ω is preconfigurated for Debian 4.0 Etch.
   If you're using another distribution please check, if config files exist in
   ./configs/dists/ and use/change them.

   These are the Variables you have to look at:

	AWSTATS_DIR = no			# Either no or path to the awstats configs dir
	SECONDARY_DNS =
	MYSQL_PREFIX_TYPE =			# '' for MYSQL_PREFIX = yes,
								# infront or behind for MYSQL_PREFIX = no

   Check the ispcp.conf and adapt it to your requirements.
   An overview over the variables you can find in the FAQ on
   http://isp-control.net

6. Return to the parent direction and build the System by using make:
	# cd ../
	# mv Makefile.fedora Makefile
	# make install

7. Copy all the directories into the system (you may make backups)
	# cp -R -L /tmp/ispcp-1.0.0/* /

8. Create the courier user database
	# chown root:root /etc/authlib/userdb
	# chmod 600 /etc/authlib/userdb
	# makeuserdb

9. Create additional folder for apache
	# mkdir /etc/httpd/vhosts
	# echo 'Include vhosts/*.conf' >> /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

11. Start the engine setup:
	# ./ispcp-setup
