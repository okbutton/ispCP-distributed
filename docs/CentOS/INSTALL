4) Preparation
--------------
For the following steps, you will need to be logged in as root.

1. First, you will need to install the RPMForge repository for some of the
   packages required. It is recommended to follow the directions located at
   http://wiki.centos.org/Repositories/RPMForge, especially concerning the
   priorities plugin.

2. Next, make sure your system packages are updated. This is as simple as running:
        # yum update

3. You now need to disable SELinux, if it is enabled. You can do this by running
   the following command:
        # setenforce 0
   Now, you will want to make sure it is off for future boots. Set "SELINUX" to
   "disabled" by editing /etc/selinux/config.

4. Untar or unzip the distribution files to a secure directory:
        # cd /root
        # tar xjvf ispcp-omega-1.0.1.tar.bz2

5. Change to the newly created directory:
        # cd ./ispcp-omega-1.0.1

6. Next, install the software packages we need. A list is conveniently provided
   and can be used to install by running the following:
        # yum install `cat ./docs/CentOS/centos-packages`
   After that, we need to install a few perl modules that aren't packaged. You
   can run the following command to install them:
        # cat ./docs/CentOS/centos-perl | xargs -I {} perl -MCPAN -e 'install {}'

   Note: If you've never run 'perl -MCPAN -e shell' before, you'll have to do this 
         first and answer 'no' to autoconfigure perl. 

7. Next, we add remi repository because Centos 5 ships with php 5.1.6 that do not work nice:
    	# wget http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/epel/5/i386/epel-release-5-3.noarch.rpm
        # wget http://rpms.famillecollet.com/el5.i386/remi-release-5-7.el5.remi.noarch.rpm
        # rpm -Uvh remi-release-5*.rpm epel-release-5*.rpm

   Then in /etc/yum.repos.d/remi.repo add 
   Edit the  /etc/yum.repos.d/remi.repo files in /etc/yum.repos.d/ and set up priorities 
   by adding the line:

        priority=1

   to a repository entry. Do same thing to /etc/yum.repos.d/epel.repo and /etc/yum.repos.d/epel-testing.repo
   Next lets update php:

        # yum --enablerepo=remi update php* mysql*

8. Now, remove Sendmail so Postfix will be the default MTA

        # yum remove sendmail

9. Install the Courier IMAP server. Packages for this are not in the default
   repositories, but are available from third-party packagers such at at
   http://www.thatfleminggent.com/. The following three packages are the latest
   versions as of the last update, but you should check the package list at the
   previous site to make sure you have the latest versions.

        # wget http://www.thatfleminggent.com/packages/centos/5/i386/courier-authlib-0.62.2-1.el5.mf.i386.rpm
        # wget http://www.thatfleminggent.com/packages/centos/5/i386/courier-authlib-userdb-0.62.2-1.el5.mf.i386.rpm
        # wget http://www.thatfleminggent.com/packages/centos/5/i386/courier-imap-4.5.0-1.el5.mf.i386.rpm
        # rpm -i courier-authlib-0.62.2-1.el5.mf.i386.rpm
        # rpm -i courier-authlib-userdb-0.62.2-1.el5.mf.i386.rpm
        # rpm -i courier-imap-4.5.0-1.el5.mf.i386.rpm

  You will also need to do some minor configuration by adding a user and group
  for courier. The following commands will acomplish this:
        # groupadd courier -g 3000
        # useradd -u 3000 -c 'Courier Mail Server' -d /dev/null -g courier -s /bin/false courier

10. Now we need to configure MySQL. To do this, it must be running. To make sure
   it is running, run the following command:
        # service mysqld start
   After it starts, you can run the mysql_secure_installation script. This will
   set up MySQL with an administrator password and make sure any non-secure
   default items like the test database are removed. This is very important if
   the server will be for shared hosting.
        # /usr/bin/mysql_secure_installation
   Make sure to remember the root password for MySQL. You will need it later.

11. Install mod_fcgid. Packages for this are not in the default
    repositories, but are available from third-party packagers such at at
    http://centos.karan.org/. The following package are the latest
    versions as of the last update, but you should check the package list at the
    previous site to make sure you have the latest versions.

        # wget http://centos.karan.org/el5/extras/testing/i386/RPMS/mod_fcgid-2.2-4.el5.kb.i386.rpm
        # rpm -i mod_fcgid-2.2-4.el5.kb.i386.rpm

12. Remove all files from /etc/httpd/conf.d

        # rm -f /etc/httpd/conf.d/*
================================================================================
5) Installation
---------------
For the following steps, you will need to be logged in as root and MySQL will
need to be running.

1. (optional) Check the ispcp.conf and adapt it to your requirements.

2. Build the System by using make:
        # make -f Makefile.centos install

3. Copy all the directories into your system (you may make backups)
        # cp -RLf /tmp/ispcp/* /
        # cp -Rv /tmp/ispcp/etc/init.d /etc/rc.d/
        # ln -s /etc/rc.d/init.d /etc/init.d
        # mkdir /var/mail/virtual

4. Now, setup some items for BIND configuration:
        # mv /var/named/data /var/named/data2
        # ln -s /var/named/chroot/var/named/data /var/named/data
        In file /var/named/chroot/etc/named.caching-nameserver.conf after line:
                include "/etc/named.rfc1912.zones";
        add
                include "/etc/named-ispcp.conf";
        Modify /var/named/chroot/etc/named.caching-nameserver.conf according your needs (default it binds only to localhost)

5. Next, we create the SASL database directory and link the configuration for
   Postfix
        # touch /etc/sasldb2
        # mkdir -p /var/spool/postfix/etc
        # cp /etc/sasldb2 /var/spool/postfix/etc/sasldb2

   Now, edit /usr/lib/sasl2/smtpd.conf to use the SASL database. Replace the
   contents of that file with the following:
        pwcheck_method: auxprop
        auxprop_plugin: sasldb
        mech_list: PLAIN LOGIN CRAM-MD5 DIGEST-MD5

6. A little bit of Apache configuration is needed:

        # echo 'include vhosts/*.conf' >> /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

        # chown apache:apache /var/www/ispcp/gui/tools/webmail/data

7. Now it's time to set up the frontend. When prompted for fastcgi version select fcgid ( press "c").
   We need to change into the right directory and run the setup tool:
        # cd /var/www/ispcp/engine/setup
        # perl ispcp-setup

        If you get no error, all went good; if you get one, look at
        http://isp-control.net to solve the problem.

================================================================================
6) Post-Installation
--------------------
1. There is a bug in some versions of courier that prevent courier-authdaemon
   from stopping with the default service script. You will need to make an edit
   to fix this. Edit /etc/init.d/courier-authlib and
        change: ${libexecdir}/authlib/authdaemon stop
        into:   killall authdaemond.plain

2. Modify some system values:
        # chmod 777 /var/www/ispcp/gui/phptmp

        * Install Daemon:
        # chkconfig --add ispcp_daemon
        # chkconfig --add ispcp_network
        # chkconfig --levels 345 ispcp_daemon on
        # chkconfig --levels 345 ispcp_network on
        # service ispcp_daemon start
        # service ispcp_network start

3. Clean the temporary folders:
        # rm -R /tmp/ispcp

================================================================================
7) Update
---------
For the following steps, you will need to be logged in as root and MySQL will
need to be running.

1. If you upgrade from VHCS 2.4.7.1 or VHCS OMEGA 2.4.8 you must first install
   ISPCP as described in INSTALL sections. Please note that ispCP Omega comes
   with a new webmail client. Please make sure that your customers can still
   access the address book data. You can ensure this either by making the old
   webmail client accessable or by using this script:
   http://www.isp-control.net/ispcp/ticket/1614.

2. Untar or unzip the distribution files to a secure directory:
    # cd /root
    # tar xjvf ispcp-omega-1.0.1.tar.bz2

3. Change to the newly created directory:
    # cd ./ispcp-omega-1.0.1

4. Next, install the software packages we need. A list is conveniently provided
   and can be used to install by running the following:
    # yum install `cat ./docs/CentOS/centos-packages`
   After that, we need to install a few perl modules that aren't packaged. You
   can run the following command to install them:
    # cat ./docs/CentOS/centos-perl | xargs -I {} perl -MCPAN -e 'install {}'

5. (optional) Check the ispcp.conf and adapt it to your requirements.

6. Stop the ispcp_deamon and build the System by using make:
	# /etc/init.d/ispcp_daemon stop
    # make -f Makefile.centos install

7. Save files
    # cp -v /var/www/ispcp/engine/ispcp-db-keys.pl /tmp/ispcp/var/www/ispcp/engine/
    # cp -v /var/www/ispcp/engine/messenger/ispcp-db-keys.pl /tmp/ispcp/var/www/ispcp/engine/messenger/
    # cp -v /var/www/ispcp/gui/include/ispcp-db-keys.php /tmp/ispcp/var/www/ispcp/gui/include/
    # cp -v /var/www/ispcp/gui/themes/user_logos/* /tmp/ispcp/var/www/ispcp/gui/themes/user_logos/

   If updating from ispCP 1.0.0 RC3 or higher:
    # cp -v /var/www/ispcp/gui/tools/pma/config.inc.php /tmp/ispcp/var/www/ispcp/gui/tools/pma/

8. Delete old files to avoid security risks:
	# rm -fR /var/www/ispcp/gui/{admin,client,include,orderpanel,themes,reseller}/
	# rm -fR /var/www/ispcp/gui/*.php

9. Copy /usr and /var directories into your system (you may make backups)
	# cp -Rv /tmp/ispcp/usr/* /usr/
	# cp -Rv /tmp/ispcp/var/* /var/

10. Backup ispcp.conf and copy the /etc directory into your system (you may make backups):
	# mv -v /etc/ispcp/ispcp.conf /etc/ispcp/ispcp.old.conf
	# cp -Rv /tmp/ispcp/etc/* /etc/

11. Now it's time to update your installation. Change into the engine directory:
	# cd /var/www/ispcp/engine/setup

12. Start the engine update:
	# perl ispcp-update

13. Update ispCP ω step-by-step

	If you get no error, all went good; if you get one, look at
	http://isp-control.net to solve the problem.

14. Clean the temporary folders:
	# rm -fR /tmp/ispcp/

================================================================================
8) Uninstall
------------
Make sure you are logged in as root and MySQL is running.

1. Change into the engine directory:
	# cd /var/www/ispcp/engine/setup

2. Start the uninstall script:
	# perl ispcp-uninstall

3. Clean up your system
