4) Installation
---------------
Make sure you are logged in as root and MySQL is running.

1. Untar or unzip the distribution files to a secure directory:
	# cd /root
	# tar xjvf ispcp-omega-1.0.0-rc7.tar.bz2

2. Change to the newly created directory:
	# cd ./ispcp-omega-1.0.0

3. Install the required modules
   First update your system:
	# apt-get update && apt-get upgrade

   for Debian Sarge use:
	# apt-get install $(cat ./docs/Debian/debian-packages-sarge)
   for Debian Etch use:
	# apt-get install $(cat ./docs/Debian/debian-packages-etch)
   for Debian Lenny/Sid use:
	# apt-get install $(cat ./docs/Debian/debian-packages-lenny)

   Make sure you have added the non-free into your /etc/apt/sources.list:

   deb     http://ftp.debian.org/debian/            etch         main contrib non-free
   deb     http://security.debian.org/              etch/updates main contrib non-free

   If using Sarge, make sure you have added the following backport into your
   /etc/apt/sources.list:

   # backports
   deb     http://dotdeb.pimpmylinux.org/          sarge          all


	(when you get to the courier screen select 'no' to web directories)
	(when you get to the postfix screen select 'internet site' and then type 'root'
	for mail. If you've set debian up correctly on install your domain should be
	already on screen. Select 'no' to force sync updates.)
	(when you get to the proftpd screen, select 'standalone')
	(when you get to the rootkithunter screen, select two time 'yes')

4. (optional) Check the ispcp.conf and adapt it to your requirements.

5. Build the System by using make:
	# make install

6. Copy all the directories into your system (you may make backups)
	# cp -Rv /tmp/ispcp/* /

7. Change or create MySQL root password, remove anonymous users, disallow root
	login remotely, remove test database (and access to it), reload privilege tables.
	# mysql_secure_installation

8. Now it's time to set up the frontend. Change into the engine directory and
	start the engine setup:
	# cd /var/www/ispcp/engine/setup
	# perl ispcp-setup

9. Install ispCP ω step-by-step

	If you get no error, all went good; if you get one, look at
	http://isp-control.net to solve the problem.

10. Clean the temporary folders:
	# rm -fR /tmp/ispcp/
