3) Introduction
---------------
ispCP ω delivers a complete hosting automation appliance by offering significant
security, total-cost-of-ownership, and performance advantages over competing
commercial solutions.

With ispCP ω you can configure your server and applications, create user with
domains with a few point-and-click operations that take less than a minute.
There is no limit to the number of resellers, users and domains that can be
created. The core of ispCP ω are 3 easy-to-use, web-based control panels. ispCP
provides graphic user interfaces for the administrators, resellers and users.

================================================================================
4) Etch Specific Note
---------------------

Debian Etch provides a version of the Apache fcgid module not compatible with 
ispCP due to the absence of a configuration directive. To use the fcgid with 
ispCP on Debian Etch, you should install it from Debian backports as follows:

1. Install all required packages as described below in step 3 of section 5.

2. Edit your '/etc/apt/source.list' to add the following repository:

	deb http://www.backports.org/debian etch-backports main contrib non-free

3. Update your packages list:
	# aptitude update

4. Install needed repository key:
	# aptitude install debian-backports-keyring

5. Install the new Apache fcgid module version:
	# aptitude -t etch-backports install libapache2-mod-fcgid

Note: Since Debian Etch is officially discontinued on February 15th, we
encourage you to migrate to Debian Lenny now.

================================================================================
5) Installation
---------------
Make sure you are logged in as root and MySQL is running.

1. Untar or unzip the distribution files to a secure directory:
	# cd /usr/local/src
	# tar xjvf ispcp-omega-1.0.5.tar.bz2

2. Change to the newly created directory:
	# cd ./ispcp-omega-1.0.5

3. Install the required packages

   First update your system:

   Etch:
	# aptitude update && aptitude upgrade
	
   Lenny, Squeeze:
	# aptitude update && aptitude safe-upgrade

   Make sure you have added the non-free into your /etc/apt/sources.list:

   Etch:
	deb     http://ftp.debian.org/debian/	etch main contrib non-free
	deb     http://security.debian.org/	etch/updates main contrib non-free

   Lenny:
	deb     http://ftp.debian.org/debian/	lenny main contrib non-free
	deb     http://security.debian.org/	lenny/updates main contrib non-free

   Squeeze:
  	deb     http://ftp.debian.org/debian/	squeeze	main contrib non-free
	deb     http://security.debian.org/	squeeze/updates main contrib non-free

   Install all required packages:

	# aptitude install lsb-release
	# aptitude install $(cat ./docs/Debian/debian-packages-`lsb_release -cs`)

	(if you get to the courier screen select 'no' to web directories)
	(if you get to the postfix screen select 'internet site'. 'mail name' should
	be the server's domain. If you've set debian up correctly on install your
	domain should be already shown.)
	(if you get to the proftpd screen, select 'standalone')

4. (optional) Check the ispcp.conf and adapt it to your requirements.

5. Build the Software by using make:
	# make install

6. Copy all the directories into your system. If you have not yet, now is a good
   time to make backups of your server. The following steps do fundamental
   changes to your system configuration.
	# cp -R /tmp/ispcp/* /

7. Change or create MySQL root password, remove anonymous users, disallow root
	login remotely, remove test database (and access to it), reload privilege tables.
	# mysql_secure_installation

8. Now it's time to set up the frontend. Change into the engine directory and
	start the engine setup:
	# cd /var/www/ispcp/engine/setup
	# perl ispcp-setup

9. Install ispCP ω step-by-step

	If you get no error, all went good; if you get one, look at
	http://isp-control.net to solve the problem.

10. Clean the temporary folders:
	# rm -fR /tmp/ispcp/

================================================================================
6) Update
---------
NOTE: ispCP ω can only be updated from post 1.0.0. If you have a
version prior 1.0.0 (final release) installed, update to ispCP ω 1.0.0 first.

Make sure you are logged in as root and MySQL is running.

1. Untar or unzip the distribution files to a secure directory:
	# cd /usr/local/src
	# tar xjvf ispcp-omega-1.0.5.tar.bz2

2. Change to the newly created directory:
	# cd ./ispcp-omega-1.0.5

3. Install the required packages

   First update your system:

   Etch:
	# aptitude update && aptitude upgrade

   Lenny, Squeeze:
	# aptitude update && aptitude safe-upgrade

   Make sure you have added the non-free into your /etc/apt/sources.list:

   Etch:
	deb     http://ftp.debian.org/debian/	etch main contrib non-free
	deb     http://security.debian.org/	etch/updates main contrib non-free

   Lenny:
	deb     http://ftp.debian.org/debian/	lenny main contrib non-free

	(if you get to the courier screen select 'no' to web directories)
	(if you get to the postfix screen select 'internet site' and then type 'root'
	for mail. If you've set debian up correctly on install your domain should be
	already on screen. Select 'no' to force sync updates.)
	(if you get to the proftpd screen, select 'standalone')
	(if you get to the rootkithunter screen, select two time 'yes')

4. Stop the ispcp_deamon and build the Software by using make:
	# /etc/init.d/ispcp_daemon stop
	# make install

5. Backup files
	# cp -v /var/www/ispcp/engine/ispcp-db-keys.pl /tmp/ispcp/var/www/ispcp/engine/
	# cp -v /var/www/ispcp/engine/messenger/ispcp-db-keys.pl /tmp/ispcp/var/www/ispcp/engine/messenger/

	# cp -v /var/www/ispcp/gui/tools/webmail/data/* /tmp/ispcp/var/www/ispcp/gui/tools/webmail/data/

	# rm -Rf /var/www/ispcp/engine/
	# rm -Rf /var/www/ispcp/gui/{admin,client,include,orderpanel,themes,reseller}/
	# rm -Rf /var/www/ispcp/gui/tools/{pma/,filemanager/,webmail/,index.php}
	# rm -Rf /var/www/ispcp/gui/{*.php,favicon.ico,robot.txt}

7. Copy /usr and /var directories into your system (you may make backups)
	# cp -R /tmp/ispcp/usr/* /usr/
	# cp -R /tmp/ispcp/var/* /var/

8. Backup ispcp.conf and copy the /etc directory into your system (you may make 
   backups):
	# mv /etc/ispcp/ispcp.conf /etc/ispcp/ispcp.old.conf
	# cp -R /tmp/ispcp/etc/* /etc/
