          using suexec module enable.
UNDER JAIL:
          dont forget to modified postfix, prepared for chroot system

5) Update
---------
Make sure you are logged in as root and MySQL is running.

1. If you upgrade from VHCS 2.4.7.1 or VHCS OMEGA 2.4.8 you must first install
   ISPCP as described in INSTALL sections. Please note that ispCP Omega comes
   with a new webmail client. Please make sure that your customers can still
   access the address book data. You can ensure this either by making the old
   webmail client accessable or by using this script:
   http://www.isp-control.net/ispcp/ticket/1614.

2. Untar or unzip the distribution files to a secure directory:
	# cd /root
	# tar xjvf ispcp-omega-1.0.2.tar.bz2

3. Change to the newly created directory:
	# cd ./ispcp-omega-1.0.2

4. Install the required modules
   see: ./docs/FreeBSD/freebsd-packages

5. (optional) Check the ispcp.conf and adapt it to your requirements.

6. Stop the ispcp_deamon and build the System by using make:
	# /etc/init.d/ispcp_daemon stop
	# make -f Makefile.fbsd install

7. Save files
	# cp -v /usr/local/www/ispcp/engine/ispcp-db-keys.pl /tmp/ispcp/usr/local/www/ispcp/engine/
	# cp -v /usr/local/www/ispcp/engine/messenger/ispcp-db-keys.pl /tmp/ispcp/usr/local/www/ispcp/engine/messenger/
	# cp -v /usr/local/www/ispcp/gui/include/ispcp-db-keys.php /tmp/ispcp/usr/local/www/ispcp/gui/include/
	# cp -v /var/www/ispcp/gui/themes/user_logos/* /tmp/ispcp/var/www/ispcp/gui/themes/user_logos/

   If updating from ispCP 1.0.0 RC3 or higher:
	# cp -v /usr/local/www/ispcp/gui/tools/pma/config.inc.php /tmp/ispcp/usr/local/www/ispcp/gui/tools/pma/

8. Delete old files to avoid security risks:
	# rm -fR /usr/local/www/ispcp/gui/admin/
	# rm -fR /usr/local/www/ispcp/gui/client/
	# rm -fR /usr/local/www/ispcp/gui/include/
	# rm -fR /usr/local/www/ispcp/gui/orderpanel/
	# rm -fR /usr/local/www/ispcp/gui/themes/
	# rm -fR /usr/local/www/ispcp/gui/reseller/
	# rm -f /usr/local/www/ispcp/gui/*.php


9. Copy /usr and /var directories into your system (you may make backups)
	# cp -Rv /tmp/ispcp/usr/* /usr/
	# cp -Rv /tmp/ispcp/var/* /var/

10. Backup ispcp.conf and copy the /etc directory into your system (you may make backups):
	# mv -v /etc/ispcp/ispcp.conf /etc/ispcp/ispcp.old.conf
	# cp -Rv /tmp/ispcp/etc/* /etc/

11. Now it's time to update your installation. Change into the engine directory:
	# cd /var/www/ispcp/engine/setup

12. Start the engine update:
	# perl ispcp-update

13. Update ispCP ω step-by-step

	If you get no error, all went good; if you get one, look at
	http://isp-control.net to solve the problem.
