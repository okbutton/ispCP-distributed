There is no must have for a system using ispCP ω. This is only a recommendation:

Penitum III or K6-4 with 500 MHz
512 MB RAM
100 MB disk space (only for install of ispCP ω)
Debian (or even any other *NIX-Distribution)

Add the following repositories via Yast:

http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/netmax/openSUSE_10.3/
http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/server:/ftp/openSUSE_10.3/
http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/network:/utilities/openSUSE_10.3/

or like this in the shell:
zypper ar http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/netmax/openSUSE_10.3/ repo-netmax
zypper ar http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/server:/ftp/openSUSE_10.3/ repo-ftp
zypper ar http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/network:/utilities/openSUSE_10.3/ repo-awstats
zypper ar http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Apache:/Modules/openSUSE_10.3/ repo-apache

While importing the packages from theese repositories the first time you have to trust theese sites.

All OpenSuse 10.3 required packages are listed in:

./docs/OpenSuse/opensuse103-packages

PHP4 related packages are removed because they are not available! Therefore PHP4
is not available in ispCP!!! If you want to use PHP4 compile it by yourself!!!

================================================================================
3) Introduction
---------------
ispCP ω delivers a complete hosting automation appliance by offering significant
security, total-cost-of-ownership, and performance advantages over competing
commercial solutions.

With ispCP ω you can configure your server and applications, create user with
domains with a few point-and-click operations that take less than a minute.
There is no limit to the number of resellers, users and domains that can be
created. The core of ispCP ω are 3 easy-to-use, web-based control panels. ispCP
provides graphic user interfaces for the administrators, resellers and users.

4) Installation
---------------
Make sure you are logged in as root and MySQL is running.

1. Untar or unzip the distribution files to a secure directory:
	# cd /root
	# tar xjvf ispcp-omega-1.0.0-rc6.tar.bz2

2. Change to the newly created directory:
	# cd ./ispcp-omega-1.0.0

3. Install the required modules
	# yast -i `cat ./docs/OpenSuse/opensuse103-packages`

   Or if you use smart package manager:
	# smart install `cat ./docs/OpenSuse/opensuse103-packages`

4. (optional) Check the ispcp.conf and adapt it to your requirements.

5. Build the System by using make:
	# make -f Makefile.opensuse install

6. Copy all the directories into your system (you may make backups before)
	# cp -RLv /tmp/ispcp/* /

7. Now it's time to set up the frontend. Change into the engine directory:
	# cd /srv/www/ispcp/engine/setup

7a. Start MySQL, if not running:
	# rcmysql restart

7b. Set the MySQL password, if not set:
	# mysqladmin -u root password YOUR_PASSWORD

7c. Disable the suse-fast-cgi:
    # mv /etc/apache2/conf.d/mod_fastcgi.conf /etc/apache2/conf.d/mod_fastcgi.conf.disabled
    # load fastcgi: edit /etc/sysconfig/apache2, look for line APACHE_MODULES=... and replace the "php5" at the end with "fastcgi proxy"

7d. Install the perl library Net::libIDN:
    # yast -i lynx ncftp lukemftp libidn-devel
    # perl -MCPAN -e 'install Net::LibIDN'
        -> every question which is asked in the first run of cpan should be ok to confirm
	(hitting Enter should be fine) - until the select of continent and country... :-)

7e. Maybe empty the folder /etc/skel - otherwise you'll have all the files/folders in the home folders...

8. Start the engine setup:
	# perl ispcp-setup

8a. Enable Apache + MySQL to start while booting:
    # insserv apache2; insserv mysql

9. Install ispCP ω step-by-step

	If you get no error, all went good; if you get one, look at
	http://isp-control.net to solve the problem.

10. Clean the temporary folders:
	# rm -fR /tmp/ispcp
