	# cd /root
	# tar xjvf ispcp-omega-1.0.0-rc4.tar.bz2

2. Change to the newly created directory:
	# cd ./ispcp-omega-1.0.0

3. Install the required modules
   First update your system:
	# apt-get update && apt-get upgrade

   for Debian Sarge please use:
	# apt-get install `cat ./docs/Debian/debian-packages-sarge`
   for Debian Etch please use:
   	# apt-get install `cat ./docs/Debian/debian-packages-etch`
   for Debian Lenny/Sid please use:
   	# apt-get install `cat ./docs/Debian/debian-packages-lenny`

   Make sure you have added the non-free into your /etc/apt/sources.list:

   deb     http://ftp.debian.org/debian/            etch         main contrib non-free
   deb     http://security.debian.org/              etch/updates main contrib non-free

   If using Sarge, make sure you have added the following backport into your
   /etc/apt/sources.list:

    # backports
    deb     http://dotdeb.pimpmylinux.org/          sarge          all


	(when you get to the courier screen select 'no' to web directories)
	(when you get to the postfix screen select 'internet site' and then type 'root'
	for mail. If you've set debian up correctly on install your domain should be
	already on screen. Select 'no' to force sync updates.)
	(when you get to the proftpd screen, select 'standalone')
	(when you get to the rootkithunter screen, select two time 'yes')

4. (optional) Check the ispcp.conf and adapt it to your requirements.
