<!-- REQUIREMENTS -->
<a name="require"></a><br />
<h2>Requirements</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        <b>PHP</b>
        <ul>
                <li>You need PHP 4.1.0 or newer, with <tt>session</tt> support (<a href="#faq1_31">*</a>)</li>
                <li>You need GD2 support in PHP to display inline
                thumbnails of JPEGs (&quot;image/jpeg: inline&quot;) with their
                original aspect ratio</li>
                <li>You need PHP 4.3.0 or newer to use the
                &quot;text/plain: external&quot;  MIME-based transformation</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>MySQL</b> 3.23.32 or newer (<a href="#faqmysqlversions">details</a>);
    </li>
    <li>
        Not really a requirement but a <b>strong suggestion</b>:
        if you are using
        the &quot;cookie&quot; authentication method, having the <tt>mcrypt</tt>
        PHP extension on your web server accelerates not only the login
        phase but every other action that you do in phpMyAdmin.
    </li>
    <li>
        a web-browser (doh!).
    </li>
</ul>


<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
<a name="intro"></a><br />
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
    phpMyAdmin can manage a whole MySQL server (needs a super-user) as well as
    a single database. To accomplish the latter you'll need a properly set up
    MySQL user who can read/write only the desired database. It's up to you to
    look up the appropriate part in the MySQL manual.<br />
    Currently phpMyAdmin can:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>easily browse through databases and tables</li>
    <li>create, copy, rename, alter and drop databases</li>
    <li>create, copy, rename, alter and drop tables</li>
    <li>do table maintenance</li>
    <li>add, edit and drop fields</li>
    <li>execute any SQL-statement, even multiple queries</li>
    <li>create, alter and drop indexes</li>
    <li>load text files into tables</li>
    <li>create (*) and read dumps of tables or databases</li>
    <li>export (*) data to SQL, CSV, XML, Word, Excel, PDF and Latex formats</li>
    <li>administer multiple servers</li>
    <li>manage MySQL users and privileges</li>
    <li>check server settings and runtime information with configuration
    hints</li>
    <li>check referential integrity in MyISAM tables</li>
    <li>using Query-by-example (QBE), create complex queries automatically connecting required tables</li>
    <li>create PDF graphics of your Database layout</li>
    <li>search globally in a database or a subset of it</li>
    <li>transform stored data into any format using a set of predefined functions,
        like displaying BLOB-data as image or download-link</li>
    <li>support InnoDB tables and foreign keys <a href="#faq3_6">(see FAQ 3.6)</a></li>
    <li>support mysqli, the improved MySQL extension <a href="#faqmysqlversions">(see FAQ 1.17)</a></li>
    <li>
        communicate in
        <a href="./translators.html">50 different languages</a>
    </li>
</ul>

<p class="footnote">
    (*)&nbsp;
        phpMyAdmin can compress (Zip, GZip -RFC 1952- or Bzip2 formats) dumps
        and CSV exports if you use PHP4&nbsp;>=&nbsp;4.0.4 with Zlib support
        (<tt>--with-zlib</tt>) and/or Bzip2 support (<tt>--with-bz2</tt>).
</p>


<!-- INSTALLATION -->
<a name="setup"></a><br />
<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>
    <span class="important">NOTE: phpMyAdmin does not apply any special security
    methods to the MySQL database server. It is still the system administrator's job to
    grant permissions on the MySQL databases properly. </span>phpMyAdmin's
    &quot;Privileges&quot; page can be used for this.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="important">Warning for Mac users:</span>if you are on a MacOS
    version before OS X, StuffIt unstuffs with Mac formats.<br />
    So you'll have to resave as in BBEdit to Unix style ALL phpMyAdmin scripts
    before uploading them to your server, as PHP seems not to like Mac-style
    end of lines character (&quot;<tt>\r</tt>&quot;).
</p>

<h3>Quick Install</h3>
<ol>
    <li> Untar or unzip the distribution (be sure to unzip the subdirectories):
         <tt>tar -xzvf phpMyAdmin_x.x.x.tar.gz</tt> in your webserver's
         document root. If you don't have direct access to your document root,
         put the files in a directory on your local machine, and, after step 3,
         transfer the directory on your web server using, for example, ftp.</li>
    <li> Ensure that all the scripts have the appropriate owner (if PHP is
         running in safe mode, having some scripts with an owner different
         from the owner of other scripts will be a
         problem). See <a href="#faq4_2">FAQ 4.2</a> and
         <a href="#faq1_26">FAQ 1.26</a> for suggestions.</li>
    <li> Create the file <tt>config.inc.php</tt> in the main (top-level)
         directory (the one that contains <tt>index.php</tt>).
         You can use setup script provided in distribution (<a
         href="scripts/setup.php">scripts/setup.php</a>) to create basics of
         config file. See <a href="#setup_script">Setup</a> chapter for
         details. If you don't like setup or want to fine tune resulting
         configuration, open (or create in case of starting from scratch)
         <tt>config.inc.php</tt> in your favorite editor and fill in there
         values for host, user, password and authentication mode to fit your
         environment. Look at <tt>libraries/config.default.php</tt> how these
         fields should be defined. Here, &quot;host&quot; means the MySQL
         server.  Have a look at <a href="#config">Configuration section</a>
         for an explanation of all values. Please also read the remaining of
         this Installation section for information about authentication modes
         and the linked-tables infrastructure.</li> <li> If you are using the
         <tt>auth_type</tt> configuration directive, it is suggested that you protect the phpMyAdmin
         installation directory, for example with HTTP&#8211;AUTH in a
         <i>.htaccess</i> file. See the <a href="#faqmultiuser">
         multi&#8211;user sub&#8211;section</a> of this FAQ for additional
         information, especially <a href="#faq4_4">FAQ 4.4</a>.</li>
    <li> Open the file
         <i>&lt;www.your-host.com&gt;/&lt;your-install-dir&gt;/index.php</i>
         in your browser. phpMyAdmin should now display a welcome screen
         and your databases, or a login dialog if using HTTP or cookie
         authentication mode.</li>
    <li> You should deny access to the <tt>libraries</tt> subfolder in your webserver
         configuration. For Apache you can use supplied .htaccess file in that
         folder, for other webservers, you should configure this yourself.
         Such configuration prevents from possible path exposure and cross
         side scripting vulnerabilities that might happen to be found in that
         code.</li>
</ol>
<a name="setup_script"></a>
<h3>Setup script usage</h3>
 <p>
    Since 2.8.0 phpMyAdmin comes with a setup script that can help you with
    creating configuration. This script is located in <tt>scripts</tt> folder: <a
    href="scripts/setup.php">scripts/setup.php</a>. Its usage is quite
simple. You follow the dialogs and this script prepares in memory the
configuration directives. You then have two choices for saving the
configuration file:
 </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Download it to your local workstation, then upload (for example
            with ftp) to your main phpMyAdmin directory. In this case, you
            don't have to prepare a special <tt>config</tt> directory, so
            no further actions are necessary.</li>
        <li>Save the file to your webserver into <tt>config</tt> directory.
        </li>
    </ol>
  <p>
    For saving file on webserver, or loading
    previous configuration you have to create <tt>config</tt> directory in
    phpMyAdmin's top level directory and make it writable to web server. For
    loading previous configuration, place it there (and make sure it has write
    permissions for webserver). On a Linux/UNIX server you can use the
    following commands:
 </p>
 <pre>
    cd phpMyAdmin
    mkdir config                        # create directory for saving
    chmod o+rw config                   # give it world writable permissions
    # if you want to edit existing configuration:
    cp config.inc.php config/           # copy current configuration
    chmod o+w config/config.inc.php     # give it world writable permissions
 </pre>
 <p>On a Windows system, create a <tt>config</tt> in the main phpMyAdmin
 directory and ensure that your web server has read/write access to it.
 <a href="#faq1_26">FAQ 1.26</a> can help you about this. If you already have
 an existing <tt>config.inc.php</tt> in your main directory, copy it to the
 newly created <tt>config</tt> directory.
 </p>
 <p>
    Then you can open <tt>scripts/setup.php</tt> in your browser and perform
    setup. After saving your configuration move generated configuration to top
    level directory and delete created <tt>config</tt> directory. Do not
    forget to remove world write permissions on <tt>config.inc.php</tt>!
 </p>
 <p>
    Please note that it does not allow to configure everything, so for some
    additional features you still need to manually edit the configuration file.
 </p>

<a name="linked-tables"></a>
<h3>Linked-tables infrastructure</h3>
 <p>
     For a whole set of new features (bookmarks, comments, SQL-history,
     PDF-generation, field contents transformation, etc.)
     you need to create a set of special tables. Those tables can be located
     in your own database, or in a central database for a multi-user
     installation (this database would then be accessed by the controluser,
     so no other user should have rights to it).
     <br /> <br />
     Please look at your scripts/
         directory, where you should find a file called <i>create_tables.sql</i>.
         (If you are using a Windows server, pay special attention to <a href="#faq1_23">FAQ 1.23</a>).
     <br /> <br />
         If your MySQL server's version is 4.1.2 or later, please use
         <i>create_tables_mysql_4_1_2+.sql</i> instead, for a new installation.
     <br /> <br />
         If you already had this infrastructure and upgraded to MySQL 4.1.2
         or later, please use <i>upgrade_tables_mysql_4_1_2+.sql</i>.
     <br /> <br />
         You can use your phpMyAdmin to create the tables for you. Please be
         aware that you may need special (administrator) privileges to create
         the database and tables, and that the script may need some tuning,
         depending on the database name.
     <br /> <br />
      After having imported the <i>create_tables.sql</i> file,
      you should specify the table names in your <i>config.inc.php</i> file. The directives
         used for that can be found in the <a href="#config">Configuration section</a>.
         You will also need to have a controluser with the proper rights to
         those tables (see section <i>Using authentication modes</i> below).
 </p>

<h3>Upgrading from an older version</h3>
<p>
        Just copy <tt>config.inc.php</tt> from previous installation into a
        newly unpacked one. If your previous phpMyAdmin version was 2.3.0 or
        older, some tweaking may be required because, as of 2.7.0, using those
        old config files is no longer supported.
        <br /> <br />
        You should <strong>not</strong> copy <tt>libraries/config.default.php</tt> over
        <tt>config.inc.php</tt> because the default configuration file
        is version-specific.
</p>

<h3>Using authentication modes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>HTTP and cookie authentication modes are recommended in a <b>multi-user
        environment</b> where you want to give users access to their own
        database and don't want them to play around with others.
        <br />
        Nevertheless be aware that MS Internet Explorer seems to be really
        buggy about cookies, at least till version 6. And PHP 4.1.1 is also a
        bit buggy in this area!<br />
        Even in a <b>single-user environment</b>, you might prefer to use
        HTTP or cookie mode so that your user/password pair are not in clear
        in the configuration file.<br /><br /></li>
    <li>HTTP and cookie authentication modes are more secure: the MySQL
        login information does not need to be set in the phpMyAdmin
        configuration file
        (except possibly for the <a href="#controluser">controluser</a>).
        <br />
        However, keep in mind that the password travels in plain text, unless
        you are using the HTTPS protocol.
        <br />
        In cookie mode, the password is stored, encrypted with the blowfish
        algorithm, in a temporary cookie.
        <br /><br /></li>

    <li>
        Note: starting with phpMyAdmin 2.6.1, this section is only applicable if
        your MySQL server is older than 4.1.2,
        or is running with <tt>--skip-show-database</tt>.
        <br /><br />
        For 'HTTP' and 'cookie' modes, phpMyAdmin needs a controluser that has
        <b>only</b> the <tt>SELECT</tt> privilege on the <i>mysql.user (all
        columns except &quot;Password&quot;)</i>, <i>mysql.db (all
        columns)</i>, <i>mysql.host (all columns)</i> and
        <i>mysql.tables_priv (all columns except
        &quot;Grantor&quot; &amp; &quot;Timestamp&quot;) </i>tables.<br /> You
        must specify the details for the <a href="#controluser">controluser</a>
        in the <i>config.inc.php</i> file under the
        <tt>$cfg['Servers'][$i]['controluser']</tt>&amp;
        <tt>$cfg['Servers'][$i]['controlpass']</tt> settings.<br /> The
        following example assumes you want to use <tt>pma</tt> as the
        controluser and <tt>pmapass</tt> as the controlpass, but <b>this is
        only an example: use something else in your file!</b><br /> Of course
        you have to replace <tt>localhost</tt> by the webserver's host if it's
        not the same as the MySQL server's one.
        <pre>

GRANT USAGE ON mysql.* TO 'pma'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'pmapass';
GRANT SELECT (
    Host, User, Select_priv, Insert_priv, Update_priv, Delete_priv,
    Create_priv, Drop_priv, Reload_priv, Shutdown_priv, Process_priv,
    File_priv, Grant_priv, References_priv, Index_priv, Alter_priv,
    Show_db_priv, Super_priv, Create_tmp_table_priv, Lock_tables_priv,
    Execute_priv, Repl_slave_priv, Repl_client_priv
    ) ON mysql.user TO 'pma'@'localhost';
GRANT SELECT ON mysql.db TO 'pma'@'localhost';
GRANT SELECT ON mysql.host TO 'pma'@'localhost';
GRANT SELECT (Host, Db, User, Table_name, Table_priv, Column_priv)
    ON mysql.tables_priv TO 'pma'@'localhost';
        </pre>
        If you are using an old MySQL version (below 4.0.2), please replace
        the first GRANT SELECT query by this one:
        <pre>

GRANT SELECT (
    Host, User, Select_priv, Insert_priv, Update_priv, Delete_priv,
    Create_priv, Drop_priv, Reload_priv, Shutdown_priv, Process_priv,
    File_priv, Grant_priv, References_priv, Index_priv, Alter_priv
    ) ON mysql.user TO 'pma'@'localhost';
        </pre>
        ... and if you want to use the many new relation and bookmark
        features:
        <pre>

GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON &lt;pma_db&gt;.* TO 'pma'@'localhost';
        </pre>
        (this of course requires that your <a href="#linked-tables">linked-tables infrastructure</a> be set up).
        <br />
        Of course, the above queries only work if your MySQL version supports
        the GRANT command. This is the case since 3.22.11.
    </li>
    <li>
        Then each of the <i>true</i> users should be granted a set of
        privileges on a set of particular databases. Normally you shouldn't
        give global privileges to an ordinary user, unless you understand
        the impact of those privileges (for example, you are creating
        a superuser).<br />
        For example, to grant the user <i>real_user</i> with
        all privileges on the database <i>user_base</i>:<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON user_base.* TO 'real_user'@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'real_password';</tt>
        <br />
        What the user may now do is controlled entirely by the MySQL user
        management system.<br />
        With HTTP or cookie authentication mode, you don't need to fill the
        user/password fields inside the <tt>$cfg['Servers']</tt> array.<br />
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>'http' authentication mode</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Was called 'advanced' in versions before 2.2.3.</li>
    <li>Introduced in 1.3.0, it uses Basic HTTP authentication method and
        allows you to login as any valid MySQL user.</li>
    <li>Is supported with most PHP configurations. For IIS (ISAPI) support
        using CGI PHP see <a href="#faq1_32">FAQ 1.32</a>, for using with
        Apache CGI see <a href="#faq1_35">FAQ 1.35</a>.</li>
    <li>See also <a href="#faq4_4">FAQ 4.4</a> about not using the
        <i>.htaccess</i> mechanism along with 'http' authentication mode.</li>
</ul>

<h4>'cookie' authentication mode</h4>
<ul>
    <li>You can use this method as a replacement for the HTTP
        authentication (for example, if you're running IIS).
    </li>
    <li>Obviously, the user must enable cookies in the browser.</li>
    <li>With this mode, the user can truly logout of phpMyAdmin and login back
        with the same username.</li>
    <li>If you want to login to arbitrary server see
    <tt><a href="#AllowArbitraryServer">$cfg['AllowArbitraryServer']</a></tt> directive.</li>
    <li>As mentioned in the <a href="#require">requirements</a> section, having the
        <tt>mcrypt</tt> extension will speed up access considerably, but is not required.</li>
</ul>
<h4>'config' authentication mode</h4>
<ul>
    <li>This mode is the less secure one because it requires you to fill the
        <tt><a href="#servers_user">$cfg['Servers'][$i]['user']</a></tt> and
        <tt><a href="#servers_user">$cfg['Servers'][$i]['password']</a></tt> fields
        (and as a result, anyone who can read your config.inc.php can discover your
        username and password).<br />
        But you don't need to setup a &quot;controluser&quot; here:
        using the <tt><a href="#servers_only_db">$cfg['Servers'][$i]['only_db']</a></tt> might be enough.</li>
    <li>In the <a href="#faqmultiuser">ISP FAQ</a> section, there is an entry explaining how to protect
        your configuration file.<br /></li>
    <li>For additional security in this mode, you may wish to consider the
        Host authentication <tt><a href="#servers_allowdeny_order">$cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowDeny']['order']</a></tt>
        and <tt><a href="#servers_allowdeny_rules">$cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowDeny']['rules']</a></tt> configuration
        directives.</li>
</ul>

        Starting with version 2.3.0, it is advisable to try leaving this
        blank. In most cases phpMyAdmin automatically detects the proper
        setting. Users of port forwarding will need to set PmaAbsoluteUri (<a

        A good test is to browse a table, edit a row and save it. There should
        be an error message if phpMyAdmin is having trouble auto&#8211;detecting        the correct value. If you get an error that this must be set or if
        the autodetect code fails to detect your path, please post a bug

        Therefore, a $cfg['Servers']-array has been added which contains
        the login information for the different servers. The first
        <tt>$cfg['Servers'][$i]['host']</tt> contains the hostname of the first
        server, the second <tt>$cfg['Servers'][$i]['host']</tt> the hostname of
        the second server, etc.

        This setting is an efficient way to lower the server load since the

        As of phpMyAdmin 2.5.5 the order inside the array is used for sorting the

        If you want to have certain databases at the top, but don't care about the others, you do not
        need to specify all other databases. Use:
        <tt>$cfg['Servers'][$i]['only_db'] = array('db3', 'db4', '*');</tt>

        Since release 2.5.0 you can store your SQL history, which means all queries you
        entered manually into the phpMyAdmin interface. If you don't want to use a table-
        based history, you can use the JavaScript-based history. Using that, all your
        history items are deleted when closing the window.<br /><br />

        Using <b><a name="cfg_QueryHistoryMax"></a>$cfg[QueryHistoryMax]</b> you can specify an amount of history items
        you want to have on hold. On every login, this list gets cut to the maximum amount.
        <br /><br />

        The query history is only available if JavaScript is enabled in your
        browser.
        <br /><br />

        To allow the usage of this functionality:
        <ul>
            <li>set up <a href="#pmadb">pmadb</a> and the linked-tables infrastructure</li>
            <li>
                put the table name in

        Because release 2.5.0 introduced the new MIME-transformation support, the
        column_info table got enhanced with three new fields. If the above variable is
        set to <tt>TRUE</tt> (default) phpMyAdmin will check if you have the latest table structure
        available. If not, it will emit a warning to the superuser.<br /><br />

        You can disable this checking behavior by setting the variable to false, which
        should offer a performance increase.<br /><br />

        Recommended to set to FALSE, when you are sure, your table structure is up to date.

        If your rule order is empty, then IP authentication is disabled.
        <br /><br />
        If your rule order is set to <tt>'deny,allow'</tt> then the system
        applies all deny rules followed by allow rules.
        Access is allowed by default. Any client which does not match a Deny
        command or does match an Allow command will be allowed access to the
        server.
        <br /><br />
        If your rule order is set to <tt>'allow,deny'</tt> then the system
        applies all allow rules followed by deny rules. Access is denied by
        default.  Any client which does not match an Allow directive or does
        match a Deny directive will be denied access to the server.
        <br /><br />
        If your rule order is set to 'explicit', the authentication is
        performed in a similar fashion to rule order 'deny,allow', with the
        added restriction that your host/username combination <b>must</b> be
        listed in the <i>allow</i> rules, and not listed in the <i>deny</i>
        rules. This is the <b>most</b> secure means of using Allow/Deny rules,
        and was available in Apache by specifying allow and deny rules without
        setting any order.

        &lt;'allow' | 'deny'&gt; &lt;username&gt; [from] &lt;ipmask&gt;
        </tt>
        <br /><br />

        If you wish to match all users, it is possible to use a <tt>'%'</tt> as
        a wildcard in the <i>username</i> field.<br />
        There are a few shortcuts you can use in the <i>ipmask</i> field as
        well (please note that those containing SERVER_ADDRESS might not be
        available on all webservers):<br /><br />
        <tt>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'all' -&gt; 0.0.0.0/0<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'localhost' -&gt; 127.0.0.1/8<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'localnetA' -&gt; SERVER_ADDRESS/8<br />

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'localnetC' -&gt; SERVER_ADDRESS/24
        </tt>
        <br /><br />

        Having an empty rule list is equivalent to either using
        <tt>'allow % from all'</tt> if your rule order is set to
        <tt>'deny,allow'</tt> or <tt>'deny % from all'</tt> if your rule order
        is set to <tt>'allow,deny'</tt> or <tt>'explicit'</tt>.

        The HeaderFlipType can be set to 'css' or 'faked'. When using 'css'
        the rotation of the header for horizontalflipped is done via CSS. If

    All those variables affect the query window feature. A <tt>SQL</tt> link
    or icon is always displayed on the left panel. If JavaScript is enabled in
    your browser, a click on this opens a distinct query window, which is
    a direct interface to enter SQL queries. Otherwise, the right panel
    changes to display a query box.
        <br /><br />
        The size of this query window can be customized with
        <tt>$cfg['QueryWindowWidth']</tt> and <tt>$cfg['QueryWindowWidth']</tt>
        - both integers for the size in pixels. Note that normally, those
        parameters will be modified in <tt>layout.inc.php</tt> for the
        theme you are using.
        <br /><br />
        If <tt>$cfg['EditInWindow']</tt> is set to true, a click on [Edit]
        from the results page (in the &quot;Showing Rows&quot; section)
        opens the query window and puts the current query
        inside it.  If set to false, clicking on the link puts the SQL
        query in the right panel's query box.
        <br /><br />
        The usage of the JavaScript query window is recommended if you have a
        JavaScript enabled browser. Basic functions are used to exchange quite
        a few variables, so most 4th generation browsers should be capable to
        use that feature. It currently is only tested with Internet Explorer 6
        and Mozilla 1.x.
        <br /><br />
        If $cfg['QueryHistoryDB'] is set to <tt>TRUE</tt>, all your Queries are logged
        to a table, which has to be created by you (see <a
        href="#history">$cfg['Servers'][$i]['history']</a>).  If set to FALSE,
        all your queries will be appended to the form, but only as long as
        your window is opened they remain saved.
        <br /><br />
        When using the JavaScript based query window, it will always get
        updated when you click on a new table/db to browse and will focus if
        you click on "Edit SQL" after using a query. You can suppress updating
        the query window by checking the box "Do not overwrite this query from
        outside the window" below the query textarea. Then you can browse
        tables/databases in the background without losing the contents of the
        textarea, so this is especially useful when composing a query with
        tables you first have to look in. The checkbox will get automatically
        checked whenever you change the contents of the textarea. Please
        uncheck the button whenever you definitely want the query window to
        get updated even though you have made alterations.
        <br /><br />
        If $cfg['QueryHistoryDB'] is set to <tt>TRUE</tt> you can specify the amount of
        saved history items using $cfg['QueryHistoryMax'].
        <br /><br />
        The query window also has a custom tabbed look to group the features.
        Using the variable $cfg['QueryWindowDefTab'] you can specify the
        default tab to be used when opening the query window. It can be set to

        Utilizes a WYSIWYG editing control to easily place elements of a PDF
        page.  By clicking on the button 'toggle scratchboard' on the page
        where you edit x/y coordinates of those elements you can activate a
        scratchboard where all your elements are placed. By clicking on an
        element, you can move them around in the pre-defined area and the x/y
        coordinates will get updated dynamically. Likewise, when entering a
        new position directly into the input field, the new position in the
        scratchboard changes after your cursor leaves the input field.
        <br />
        You have to click on the 'OK'-button below the tables to save the new
        positions.  If you want to place a new element, first add it to the
        table of elements and then you can drag the new element around.
        <br />
        By changing the paper size and the orientation you can change the size
        of the scratchboard as well. You can do so by just changing the
        dropdown field below, and the scratchboard will resize automatically,
        without interfering with the current placement of the elements.
        <br />
        If ever an element gets out of range you can either enlarge the paper
        size or click on the 'reset' button to place all elements below each
        other.

<a name="transformations"></a><br />
<h2>Transformations</h2>

<p>
<a href="#transformationsintro">Introduction</a> &nbsp;-&nbsp;
<a href="#transformationshowto">Usage</a> &nbsp;-&nbsp;
<a href="#transformationsfiles">File structure</a>
</p>

<a name="transformationsintro"></a><br />
<h3>[1. Introduction]</h3>

<p>To enable transformations, you have to setup the <tt>column_info</tt> table and the proper
directives. Please see the <a href="#config">Configuration section</a> on how to do so.</p>
<br />

<p>You can apply different transformations to the contents of each field. The
transformation will take the content of each field and transform it with
certain rules defined in the selected transformation.</p><br />

<p>Say you have a field 'filename' which contains a filename. Normally you would see
in phpMyAdmin only this filename. Using transformations you can transform that filename
into a HTML link, so you can click inside of the phpMyAdmin structure on the field's
link and will see the file displayed in a new browser window. Using transformation
options you can also specify strings to append/prepend to a string or the format you
want the output stored in.</p><br />

<p>For a general overview of all available transformations and their options, you can
consult your
<i>&lt;www.your-host.com&gt;/&lt;your-install-dir&gt;/transformation_overview.php</i>
installation.</p>

<p><br />For a tutorial on how to effectively use transformations, see our <a href="http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/docs.php">Link section</a> on the official phpMyAdmin homepage.</p>

<a name="transformationshowto"></a><br />
<h3>[2. Usage]</h3>

<p>Go to your <i>tbl_properties_structure.php</i> page (i.e. reached through
clicking on the 'Structure' link for a table). There click on
&quot;Change&quot; (or change icon) and there you will see three new fields at
the end of the line. They are called 'MIME-type', 'Browser transformation' and
'Transformation options'.</p>

<ul>
<li>The field 'MIME-type' is a dropdown field. You have the options to leave that field
empty or to use 'auto' [this feature is not yet available]. Please note that
transformations are inactive as long as no MIME-type is selected.</li>

<li>The field 'Browser transformation' is a drop-down field. You can choose from a
hopefully growing amount of pre-defined transformations. See below for information on
how to build your own transformation.<br />

There are global transformations and mimetype-bound transformations. Global transformations
can be used for any mimetype. They will take the mimetype, if necessary, into regard.
Mimetype-bound transformations usually only operate on a certain mimetype. There are
transformations which operate on the main mimetype (like 'image'), which will most likely
take the subtype into regard, and those who only operate on a
specific subtype (like 'image/jpeg').<br />

You can use transformations on mimetypes for which the function was not defined for. There
is no security check for you selected the right transformation, so take care of what the
output will be like.</li>

<li>The field 'Transformation options' is a free-type textfield. You have to enter
transform-function specific options here. Usually the transforms can operate with default
options, but it is generally a good idea to look up the overview to see which options are
necessary.<br />

Much like the ENUM/SET-Fields, you have to split up several options using the format
'a','b','c',...(NOTE THE MISSING BLANKS). This is because internally the options will be
parsed as an array, leaving the first value the first element in the array, and so
forth.<br />

If you want to specify a MIME character set you can define it in the transformation_options.
You have to put that outside of the pre-defined options of the specific mime-transform,
as the last value of the set. Use the format "'; charset=XXX'". If you use a transform,
for which you can specify 2 options and you want to append a character set, enter "'first
parameter','second parameter','charset=us-ascii'". You can, however use the defaults for
the parameters: "'','','charset=us-ascii'".</li>
</ul>

<a name="transformationsfiles"></a><br />
<h3>[3. File structure]</h3>

<p>All mimetypes and their transformations are defined through single files in
the directory 'libraries/transformations/'.</p><br />

<p>They are stored in files to ease up customization and easy adding of new
transformations.</p><br />

<p>Because the user cannot enter own mimetypes, it is kept sure that transformations
always work. It makes no sense to apply a transformation to a mimetype, the
transform-function doesn't know to handle.</p><br />

<p>One can, however, use empty mime-types and global transformations which should work
for many mimetypes. You can also use transforms on a different mimetype they where built
for, but pay attention to option usage as well as what the transformation does to your
field.</p><br />

<p>There is a basic file called '<i>global.inc.php</i>'. This function can be included by
any other transform function and provides some basic functions.</p><br />

<p>There are 5 possible file names:</p>

<ol>
<li>A mimetype+subtype transform:<br /><br />

    [mimetype]_[subtype]__[transform].inc.php<br /><br />

    Please not that mimetype and subtype are separated via '_', which shall not be
    contained in their names. The transform function/filename may contain only
    characters which cause no problems in the file system as well as the PHP function
    naming convention.<br /><br />

    The transform function will the be called 'PMA_transform_[mimetype]_[subtype]__[transform]()'.<br /><br />

    <b>Example:</b><br /><br />

    text_html__formatted.inc.php<br />
    PMA_transform_text_html__formatted()</li>

<li>A mimetype (w/o subtype) transform:<br /><br />

    [mimetype]__[transform].inc.php<br /><br />

    Please note that there are no single '_' characters.
    The transform function/filename may contain only characters which cause no problems
    in the file system as well as the PHP function naming convention.<br /><br />

    The transform function will the be called 'PMA_transform_[mimetype]__[transform]()'.<br /><br />

    <b>Example:</b><br /><br />

    text__formatted.inc.php<br />
    PMA_transform_text__formatted()</li>

<li>A mimetype+subtype without specific transform function<br /><br />

    [mimetype]_[subtype].inc.php<br /><br />

    Please note that there are no '__' characters in the filename. Do not use special
    characters in the filename causing problems with the file system.<br /><br />

    No transformation function is defined in the file itself.<br /><br />

    <b>Example:</b><br /><br />

    text_plain.inc.php<br />
    (No function)</li>

<li>A mimetype (w/o subtype) without specific transform function<br /><br />

    [mimetype].inc.php<br /><br />

    Please note that there are no '_' characters in the filename. Do not use special
    characters in the filename causing problems with the file system.<br /><br />

    No transformation function is defined in the file itself.<br /><br />

    <b>Example:</b><br /><br />

    text.inc.php<br />
    (No function)</li>

<li>A global transform function with no specific mimetype<br /><br />

    global__[transform].inc.php<br /><br />

    The transform function will the be called 'PMA_transform_global__[transform]()'.<br /><br />

    <b>Example:</b><br /><br />

    global__formatted<br />
    PMA_transform_global__formatted()</li>
</ol>

<br />
<p>So generally use '_' to split up mimetype and subtype, and '__' to provide a
transform function.</p><br />

<p>All filenames containing no '__' in themselves are not shown as valid transform
functions in the dropdown.</p><br />

<p>Please see the libraries/transformations/TEMPLATE file for adding your own transform
function. See the libraries/transformations/TEMPLATE_MIMETYPE for adding a mimetype
without a transform function. Also note the introduction of a function description in
the language files. For each function a $strTransformation_[filename without .inc.php]
has to exist.</p><br />

<p>You can use the template generator to generate new functions and entries in the
language file.</p><br />

<p>To create a new transform function please see libraries/transformations/template_generator.sh.
To create a new, empty mimetype please see libraries/transformations/template_generator_mimetype.sh.</p><br />

<p>A transform function always gets passed three variables:</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>$buffer</b> - Contains the text inside of the column. This is the text, you want to transform.</li>
    <li><b>$options</b> - Contains any user-passed options to a transform function as an array.</li>
    <li><b>$meta</b> - Contains an object with field information to your column. The data is drawn from the output of the
    <a href="http://www.php.net/mysql_fetch_field">mysql_fetch_field()</a> function. This means, all object properties described
    on the <a href="http://www.php.net/mysql_fetch_field">manual page</a> are available in this variable and can be used to
    transform a field accordingly to unsigned/zerofill/not_null/... properties.<br />
    The $meta-&gt;mimetype variable contains the original MIME-type of the field (i.e. 'text/plain', 'image/jpeg' etc.)</li>
</ol>

<p>
    This is a known PHP bug (see this
    <a href="http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=16626">bug report</a>) from the

<h4>
    [<a href="#faq1_7">1.7</a>] How can I GZip or Bzip a dump or a CSV export? It does not seem to

</h4>
<p>
    These features are based on the <tt>gzencode()</tt> and
    <tt>bzcompress()</tt> PHP functions to be more independent of the platform
    (Unix/Windows, Safe Mode or not, and so on).
    So, you must have PHP4&nbsp;>=&nbsp;4.0.4 and Zlib/Bzip2 support
    (<tt>--with-zlib</tt> and <tt>--with-bz2</tt>).<br />
    We faced PHP crashes when trying to download a dump with MS Internet
    Explorer when phpMyAdmin is run with a release candidate of PHP 4.2.0. In
    this case you should switch to the release version of PHP 4.2.0.

<h4>
    [<a href="#faq1_8">1.8</a>] I cannot insert a text file in a table, and I get an error about

</h4>
<p>
    Your uploaded file is saved by PHP in the &quot;upload dir&quot;, as
    defined in <i>php.ini</i> by the variable <tt>upload_tmp_dir</tt> (usually
    the system default is <i>/tmp</i>).
    <br />
    We recommend the following setup for Apache servers running in safe mode,
    to enable uploads of files while being reasonably secure:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>create a separate directory for uploads:
           <tt>mkdir /tmp/php</tt></li>
   <li>give ownership to the Apache server's user.group:
           <tt>chown apache.apache /tmp/php</tt></li>
   <li>give proper permission: <tt>chmod 600 /tmp/php</tt></li>
   <li>put <tt>upload_tmp_dir = /tmp/php</tt> in <i>php.ini</i></li>
   <li>restart Apache</li>
</ul>

    don't work on my system and uploaded files have a <tt>Content-Type:</tt>
    header in the first line.
</h4>
<p>
    It's not really phpMyAdmin related but RedHat 7.0. You have a RedHat 7.0
    and you updated your PHP RPM to php-4.0.4pl1-3.i386.rpm, didn't you?
    <br />
    So the problem is that this package has a serious bug that was corrected
    ages ago in PHP (2001-01-28: see
    <a href="http://www.php.net/bugs.php?id=8966">PHP's bug tracking system</a>
    for more details). The problem is that the bugged package is still
    available though it was corrected (see
    <a href="http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=24933">RedHat's BugZilla</a>
    for more details).
    <br />
    So please download
    <a href="http://www.redhat.com/swr/i386/php-4.0.4pl1-9.i386.html">the fixed package (4.0.4pl1-9)</a>
    and the problem should go away.
    <br />
    And that fixes the \r\n problem with file uploads!

<p>

<h4>

    the query box.
</h4>
<p>
    Since version 2.2.4, phpMyAdmin supports servers with open_basedir
    restrictions. Assuming that the restriction allows you to open files in the
    current directory ('.'), all you have to do is create a 'tmp' directory
    under the phpMyAdmin install directory, with permissions 777 and the same
    owner as the owner of your phpMyAdmin directory. The  uploaded files will
    be moved there, and after execution of your SQL commands, removed.

</h4>
<p>
    In older MySQL versions, the <tt>User</tt> and <tt>Password</tt> fields
    were named <tt>user</tt> and <tt>password</tt>. Please modify your field
    names to align with current standards.
</p>

<a name="faq1_16"></a>
<h4>
    [<a href="#faq1_16">1.16</a>] I cannot upload big dump files (memory, http or timeout problems).
</h4>
<p> Starting with version 2.7.0, the import engine has been re&#8211;written and these
    problems should not occur. If possible, upgrade your phpMyAdmin to the latest version
    to take advantage of the new import features.
</p>
<p>
    The first things to check (or ask your host provider to check) are the
    values of <tt>upload_max_filesize</tt>, <tt>memory_limit</tt> and
    <tt>post_max_size</tt> in the <i>php.ini</i> configuration file.
    All of these three settings limit the maximum size of data that can be
    submitted and handled by PHP. One user also said that post_max_size
    and memory_limit need to be larger than upload_max_filesize.
    <br /> <br />
    There exist several workarounds if your upload is too big or your
    hosting provider is unwilling to change the settings:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Look at the <tt>$cfg['UploadDir']</tt> feature. This allows one to
    upload a file to the server via scp, ftp, or your favorite file transfer
    method. PhpMyAdmin is then able to import the files from the temporary
    directory. More information is available in the <a href="#config">Configuration
    section</a> of this document.</li>
    <li>Using a utility (such as <a href="http://www.ozerov.de/bigdump.php">
    BigDump</a>) to split the files before uploading. We cannot support this
    or any third party applications, but are aware of users having success
    with it.</li>
    <li>If you have shell (command line) access, use MySQL to import the files
    directly. You can do this by issuing the &quot;source&quot; command from
    within MySQL: <tt>source <i>filename.sql</i></tt>.</li>
</ul>

<a name="faqmysqlversions"></a>
<h4>
    [<a href="#faqmysqlversions">1.17</a>] Which MySQL versions does phpMyAdmin support?
</h4>
<p>
    All MySQL versions from 3.23.32 till 5.0 (except for 4.1.0 and 4.1.1) are
    fully supported. Please note that the older your MySQL version is, the more
    limitations you will have to face.
    <br />
    phpMyAdmin may connect to your MySQL server using php's classic
    <a href="http://php.net/mysql">MySQL extension</a> as well as the
    <a href="http://php.net/mysqli">improved MySQL extension (MySQLi)</a> that
    is available in php 5.0.
    <br />
    Either way, the developers of both extensions recommend to use the classic
    extension for MySQL 4.0 and below and MySQLi for MySQL 4.1 and newer.
    <br />
    When compiling php, we strongly recommend that you manually link the MySQL
    extension of your choice to a MySQL client library of at least the same
    minor version since the one that is bundled with some php distributions is
    rather old and might cause problems (see also FAQ 1.17a).
    If your webserver is running on a windows system, you might want to try
    MySQL's
    <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/php/">Connector/PHP</a>
    instead of the MySQL / MySQLi extensions that are bundled with the official
    php Win32 builds.
    <br />
    MySQL&nbsp;5.1 is not yet supported.
</p>

<a name="faq1_17a"></a>
<h4>
    [<a href="#faq1_17a">1.17a</a>] I cannot connect to the MySQL server. It always returns the error
    message, &quot;Client does not support authentication protocol requested
    by server; consider upgrading MySQL client&quot;
</h4>
<p>
    You tried to access MySQL with an old MySQL client library. The version of
    your MySQL client library can be checked in your phpinfo() output.
    In general, it should have at least the same minor version as your server
    - as mentioned in FAQ 1.17.
    <br /><br />
    This problem is generally caused by using MySQL version 4.1 or newer. MySQL
    changed the authentication hash and your PHP is trying to use the old method.
    The proper solution is to use the <a href="http://www.php.net/mysqli">mysqli extension</a>
    with the proper client library to match your MySQL installation. Your
    chosen extension is specified in <tt>$cfg['Servers'][$i]['extension']</tt>.
    More information (and several workarounds) are located in the
    <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/old-client.html">MySQL Documentation</a>.

<p>
    This is a bug of MySQL&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;4.0.1. Please upgrade to at least

<h4>
    [<a href="#faqmysql">1.20</a>] I receive the error &quot;cannot load MySQL extension, please
    check PHP Configuration&quot;.
</h4>
<p>
    To connect to a MySQL server, PHP needs a set of MySQL functions called
    &quot;MySQL extension&quot;.
    This extension may be part of the PHP distribution (compiled-in), otherwise
    it needs to be loaded dynamically. Its name is probably <i>mysql.so</i> or
    <i>php_mysql.dll</i>. phpMyAdmin tried to load the extension but failed.
    <br /><br />
    Usually, the problem is solved by installing a software package called
    &quot;PHP-MySQL&quot; or something similar.

    this behavior by simply changing the directive to 0 (<tt>OFF</tt>):<br />
    Just edit your <tt>my.ini</tt> file that should be located in your Windows
    directory and add the following line to the group [mysqld]:<br />

    The problems occur when two different (and conflicting) set of directives
    are used:

    <tt>/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf</tt>, while
    the other set was in <tt>/etc/httpd/conf/addon-modules/php.conf</tt>.<br />
    The recommended way is with <tt>AddType</tt>, so just comment out
    the first set of lines and restart Apache:

</h4>
<p><br />
    For RedHat users, Harald Legner suggests this on the mailing list:
    <br /><br />
    On my RedHat-Box the socket of MySQL is <i>/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock</i>.
    In your <i>php.ini</i> you will find a line
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>mysql.default_socket = /tmp/mysql.sock</tt>
    <br />
    change it to
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>mysql.default_socket = /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock</tt>
    <br />
    Then restart apache and it will work.
    <br /><br />
    Here is a fix suggested by Brad Ummer:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        First, you need to determine what socket is being used by MySQL.
        <br />
        To do this, telnet to your server and go to the MySQL bin directory. In
        this directory there should be a file named <i>mysqladmin</i>. Type
        <tt>./mysqladmin variables</tt>, and this should give you a bunch of
        info about your MySQL server, including the socket
        (<i>/tmp/mysql.sock</i>, for example).
    </li>
    <li>
        Then, you need to tell PHP to use this socket.<br /> To do this in
        phpMyAdmin, you need to complete the  socket information in the
        <i>config.inc.php</i>.<br />
        For example:
        <tt>$cfg['Servers'][$i]['socket']&nbsp;=&nbsp;'/tmp/mysql.sock';</tt><br /><br />
        Please also make sure that the permissions of this file allow to be readable
        by your webserver (i.e. '0755').
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Have also a look at the
    <a href="http://www.mysql.com/doc/C/a/Can_not_connect_to_server.html" target="_blank">
         corresponding section of the MySQL documentation</a>.

<p>
    When you are using a port on your localhost, which you redirect via
    port-forwarding to another host, MySQL is not resolving the localhost
    as expected.<br />
    Erik Wasser explains: The solution is: if your host is &quot;localhost&quot;
    MySQL (the commandline tool 'mysql' as well) always tries to use the socket
    connection for speeding up things. And that doesn't work in this configuration
    with port forwarding.<br />
    If you enter "127.0.0.1" as hostname, everything is right and MySQL uses the

<a name="faqthemes"></a>
<h4>
    [<a href="#faqthemes">2.7</a>] Using and creating themes
</h4>
<p>
    Themes are configured with <tt>$cfg['ThemePath']</tt>,
    <tt>$cfg['ThemeManager']</tt> and <tt>$cfg['ThemeDefault']</tt>.<br />
    <br />
    Under <tt>$cfg['ThemePath']</tt>, you should not delete the directory
    &quot;original&quot; or its underlying structure, because this is
    the system theme used by phpMyAdmin. &quot;original&quot; contains all
    images and styles, for backwards compatibility and for all themes that
    would not include images or css-files.<br />
    <br />
    If <tt>$cfg['ThemeManager']</tt> is enabled, you can select your
    favorite theme on the main page. Your selected theme will be stored
    in a cookie.<br />
    <br />
    </p>
    <p>
    To create a theme:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>make a new subdirectory (for example &quot;your_theme_name&quot;) under <tt>$cfg['ThemePath']</tt> (by default <tt>themes</tt>)</li>
        <li>copy the files and directories from &quot;original&quot; to &quot;your_theme_name&quot;</li>
        <li>edit the css-files in &quot;your_theme_name/css&quot;</li>
        <li>put your new images in &quot;your_theme_name/img&quot;</li>
        <li>edit <tt>layout.inc.php</tt> in &quot;your_theme_name&quot;</li>
        <li>edit <tt>info.inc.php</tt> in &quot;your_theme_name&quot; to
        contain your chosen theme name, that will be visible in user interface</li>
        <li>make a new screenshot of your theme and save it under &quot;your_theme_name/screen.png&quot;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    In theme directory there is file <tt>info.inc.php</tt> which contains
    theme verbose name, theme generation and theme version. These versions and
    generations are enumerated from 1 and do not have any direct dependence on
    phpMyAdmin version. Themes within same generation should be backwards
    compatible - theme with version 2 should work in phpMyAdmin requiring
    version 1. Themes with different generation are incompatible.
    </p>
    <p>
    If you do not want to use your own symbols and buttons, remove the
    directory &quot;img&quot; in &quot;your_theme_name&quot;. phpMyAdmin will
    use the default icons and buttons (from the system-theme &quot;original&quot;).

    The invalid part of the code is the horizontal line made of dashes that

</h4>
<p>
    Your table neither have a primary key nor an unique one, so we must use a

    Due to a surrounding form-container (for multi-row delete checkboxes), no nested forms can be put inside the table where
    phpMyAdmin displays the results. You can, however, use any form inside of a table if keep the parent form-container with
    the target to tbl_row_delete.php and just put your own input-elements inside. If you use a custom submit input field, the
    form will submit itself to the displaying page again, where you can validate the $HTTP_POST_VARS in a transformation.

Most important of all, the quote-character (") is interpreted as an identifier quote character and not as a string quote character, which makes many internal phpMyAdmin operations into invalid SQL statements. There is no workaround to this behaviour.

    [<a href="#faq4_2">4.2</a>] What's the preferred way of making phpMyAdmin secure against evil

</h4>
<p>
    This depends on your system.<br />
    If you're running a server which cannot be accessed by other people, it's
    sufficient to use the directory protection bundled with your webserver
    (with Apache you can use <i>.htaccess</i> files, for example).<br />
    If other people have telnet access to your server, you should use
    phpMyAdmin's HTTP or cookie authentication features.
    <br /><br />
    Suggestions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Your <i>config.inc.php</i> file should be <tt>chmod 660</tt>.
    </li>
    <li>
        All your phpMyAdmin files should be chown -R phpmy.apache, where phpmy
        is a user whose password is only known to you, and apache is the
        group under which Apache runs.
    </li>
    <li>
        You should use PHP safe mode, to protect from other users that try
        to include your <i>config.inc.php</i> in their scripts.
    </li>
</ul>

    be a major benefit here if your installation is suited to using it. Then

    <br /><br />
    If you want a pre-made sample, you can try this fragment. It stops the

<p>
    Your table neither have a primary key nor an unique one, so we must use a
    long URL to identify this row. There is a limit on the length of the URL in
    those browsers, and this not happen in Netscape, for example. The
    workaround is to create a primary or unique key, or use another browser.

</h4>
<p>
    First the configuration variables &quot;relation&quot;,
    &quot;table_coords&quot; and &quot;pdf_pages&quot; have to be filled in.
    <br /><br />
    Then you need to think about your schema layout. Which tables will go on
    which pages?
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Select your database in the left frame.</li>
    <li>Choose &quot;Operations&quot; in the navigation bar at the top.</li>
    <li>Choose &quot;Edit PDF Pages&quot; near the bottom of the page.</li>
    <li>Enter a name for the first PDF page and click Go. If you like, you
        can use the &quot;automatic layout,&quot; which will put all your
        linked tables onto the new page.</li>
    <li>Select the name of the new page (making sure the Edit radio button
        is selected) and click Go.</li>
    <li>Select a table from the list, enter its coordinates and click Save.<br />
        Coordinates are relative; your diagram will
        be automatically scaled to fit the page. When initially placing tables
        on the page, just pick any coordinates -- say, 50x50. After clicking
        Save, you can then use the <a href="#wysiwyg">graphical editor</a> to
        position the element correctly.</li>
    <li>When you'd like to look at your PDF, first be sure to click the Save
        button beneath the list of tables and coordinates, to save any changes
        you made there. Then scroll all the way down, select the PDF options
        you want, and click Go.</li>
    <li>Internet Explorer for Windows may suggest an incorrect filename when
        you try to save a generated PDF. When saving a generated PDF, be
        sure that the filename ends in &quot;.pdf&quot;, for example
        &quot;schema.pdf&quot;. Browsers on other operating systems, and other
        browsers on Windows, do not have this problem.</li>

    This is a bad idea, because in MySQL the syntax &quot;database.table&quot;

<a name="faqsqlvalidator"></a>
<h4>
    [<a href="#faqsqlvalidator">6.14</a>] How do I set up the SQL Validator?
</h4>
<p>
    To use it, you need a very recent version of PHP, 4.3.0 recommended, with
    XML, PCRE and PEAR support. On your system command line, run
    <tt>"pear install Net_Socket Net_URL HTTP_Request Mail_Mime Net_DIME
      SOAP"</tt> to get the necessary PEAR modules for usage.
    <br />
    On a more recent pear version, I had problems with the state of Net_DIME
    being beta, so this single command
    <tt>"pear -d preferred_state=beta install -a SOAP"</tt> installed
    all the needed modules.
    <br />
    If you use the Validator, you should be aware that any SQL statement you
    submit will be stored anonymously (database/table/column names,
    strings, numbers replaced with generic values). The Mimer SQL
    Validator itself, is &copy; 2001 Upright Database Technology.
    We utilize it as free SOAP service.

<p>
    The right way to do this, is to create the field without any indexes,
    then display the table structure and use the &quot;Create an index&quot;

</h4>
<p>
    Slow down :). Defining mimetypes is of no use, if you can't put transformations on them.
    Otherwise you could just put a comment on the field. Because entering your own mimetype will
    cause serious syntax checking issues and validation, this introduces a high-risk false-user-input
    situation. Instead you have to initialize mimetypes using functions or empty mimetype definitions.
    <br />
    Plus, you have a whole overview of available mimetypes. Who knows all those mimetypes by heart so

<a name="faqbookmark"></a>
<h4>
    [<a href="#faqbookmark">6.18</a>] Bookmarks: Where can I store bookmarks? Why can't I see any bookmarks below the query box?
     What is this variable for?
</h4>
<p>
    Any query you have executed can be stored as a bookmark on the page where the results are displayed.
    You will find a button labeled 'Bookmark this query' just at the end of the page.<br />
    As soon as you have stored a bookmark, it is related to the database you run the query on. You can
    now access a bookmark dropdown on each page, the query box appears on for that database.<br />
    <br />
    Since phpMyAdmin 2.5.0 you are also able to store variables for the bookmarks. Just use the string
    <b>/*[VARIABLE]*/</b> anywhere in your query. Everything which is put into the <i>value</i> input
    box on the query box page will replace the string &quot;/*[VARIABLE]*/&quot; in your stored query.
    Just be aware of that you HAVE to create a valid query, otherwise your query won't be even able to be
    stored in the database.<br />
    Also remember, that everything else inside the <b>/*[VARIABLE]*/</b> string for your query will remain
    the way it is, but will be stripped of the /**/ chars. So you can use:<br /><br />
    <code>/*, [VARIABLE] AS myname */</code><br /><br />
    which will be expanded to<br /><br />
    <code>, VARIABLE as myname</code><br /><br />
    in your query, where VARIABLE is the string you entered in the input box. If an empty string is
    provided, no replacements are made.<br />
    <br />
    A more complex example. Say you have stored this query:<br /><br />
    <code>SELECT Name, Address FROM addresses WHERE 1 /* AND Name LIKE '%[VARIABLE]%' */</code><br /><br />
    Say, you now enter &quot;phpMyAdmin&quot; as the variable for the stored query, the full query will
    be:<br /><br />
    <code>SELECT Name, Address FROM addresses WHERE 1 AND Name LIKE '%phpMyAdmin%'</code>
    <br />
    <br />
    You can use multiple occurrences of <b>/*[VARIABLE]*/</b> in a single query.<br />
    <b>NOTE THE ABSENCE OF SPACES</b> inside the &quot;/**/&quot; construct. Any spaces inserted there
    will be later also inserted as spaces in your query and may lead to unexpected results especially when
    using the variable expansion inside of a &quot;LIKE ''&quot; expression.<br />
    Your initial query which is going to be stored as a bookmark has to yield at least one result row so

<h4>
    [<a href="#faq6_19">6.19</a>] How can I create simple LaTeX document to include exported table?
</h4>
<p>
    You can simply include table in your LaTeX documents, minimal sample
    document should look like following one (assuming you have table
    exported in file <code>table.tex</code>):
</p>

<pre>
\documentclass{article} % or any class you want
\usepackage{longtable}  % for displaying table
\begin{document}        % start of document
\include{table}         % including exported table
\end{document}          % end of document
</pre>

<h4>
    [<a href="#faq6_20">6.20</a>] In MySQL 4, I see a lot of databases which are not mine, and cannot
    access them.
</h4>
<p>
    Upgrading to MySQL 4 usually gives users those global privileges: CREATE
    TEMPORARY TABLES, SHOW DATABASES, LOCK TABLES. Those privileges also
    enable users to see all the database names.
    See this <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/179">bug report</a>.    <br /><br />
    So if your users do not need those privileges, you can remove them and their
    databases list will shorten.

<h4>
    [<a href="#faq6_21">6.21</a>] In edit/insert mode, how can I see a list of possible values for
    a field, based on some foreign table?
</h4>
<p>
    You have to setup appropriate links between the tables, and also
    setup the &quot;display field&quot; in the foreign table. See <a href="#faq6_6">FAQ
    6.6</a> for an example. Then, if there are 200 values or less in the
    foreign table, a drop-down list of values will be available.
    You will see two lists of values, the first list containing the key
    and the display field, the second list containing the display field
    and the key. The reason for this is to be able to type the first
    letter of either the key or the display field.
    <br /><br />
    For 200 values or more, a distinct window will appear, to browse foreign
    key values and choose one.

<h4>
    [<a href="#faq6_22">6.22</a>] Bookmarks: Can I execute a default bookmark automatically
    when entering Browse mode for a table?
</h4>
<p>
    Yes. If a bookmark has the same label as a table name, it will be
    executed.

<h4>
    [<a href="#faq6_23">6.23</a>] Export: I heard phpMyAdmin can export Microsoft Excel files, how
    can I enable that?
</h4>
<p>
    Current version does support direct export to Microsoft Excel and Word
    versions 2000 and newer. If you need export older versions, you can use
    CSV suitable for Microsoft Excel, which works out of the box or you can
    try native <b>experimental</b> MS Excel exporter. <b>This export has
    several problems, most important are limitation of cell content to 255
    chars and no support for charsets, so think carefully whether you want to
    enable this.</b>.  For enabling this you need to set $cfg['TempDir'] to
    place where web server user can write (for example <tt>'./tmp'</tt>) and
    install PEAR module Spreadsheet_Excel_Writer into php include path. The
    installation can be done by following command:
</p>
<pre>
    pear -d preferred_state=beta install -a Spreadsheet_Excel_Writer
</pre>
<p>
    First part of switches set we want to install beta version of that module
    (no stable version available yet) and then we tell pear we want to satisfy
    dependencies.
</p>
<p>
    If you are running in PHP safe mode, you will have to set
    in <tt>php.ini</tt> the <tt>safe_mode_include_dir</tt> to the directory
    where your PEAR modules are located, for example:
</p>
<pre>
    safe_mode_include_dir = /usr/local/lib/php
</pre>
<p>
    To create the temporary directory on a UNIX-based system, you can do:
</p>
<pre>
    cd phpMyAdmin
    mkdir tmp
    chmod o+rwx tmp
</pre>

<h4>
    [<a href="#faq6_24">6.24</a>] Now that phpMyAdmin supports native MySQL 4.1.x column comments,
    what happens to my column comments stored in pmadb?
</h4>
<p> Automatic migration of a table's pmadb-style column comments to the native
    ones is done whenever you enter Structure page for this table.

<h4>
    [<a href="#faq7_1">7.1</a>] I have found a bug. How do I inform developers?
</h4>
<p>
    Our Bug Tracker is located at
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpmyadmin/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpmyadmin/</a>
    under the Bugs section.
    <br /><br />
    But please first discuss your bug with other users:

<h4>
    [<a href="#faq7_2">7.2</a>] I want to translate the messages to a new language or upgrade an
    existing language, where do I start?
</h4>
<p>
    Always use the current CVS version of your language file.
    For a new language, start from <i>english-iso-8859-1.inc.php</i>. If you
    don't  know how to get the CVS version, please ask one of the developers.
    <br />
    Please note that we try not to use HTML entities like &amp;eacute; in
    the translations, since we define the right character set in the file.
    With HTML entities, the text on JavaScript messages would not
    display correctly.
    However there are some entities that need to be there, for quotes
    ,non-breakable spaces, ampersands, less than, greater than.
    <br />
    You can then put your translations, as a zip file to avoid losing special
    characters, on the sourceforge.net translation tracker.
    <br />
    It would be a good idea to subscribe to the phpmyadmin-translators mailing
    list, because this is where we ask for translations of new messages.

    [<a href="#faq7_3">7.3</a>] I would like to help out with the development of phpMyAdmin. How
    should I proceed?
</h4>
<p>
    The following method is preferred for new developers:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        fetch the current CVS tree over anonymous CVS:<br />
        <tt>cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.phpmyadmin.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/phpmyadmin login</tt><br />
        [Password: simply press the Enter key]<br />
        <tt>cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.phpmyadmin.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/phpmyadmin checkout phpMyAdmin</tt><br />
        [This will create a new sub-directory named phpMyAdmin]
    </li>
    <li>
        add your stuff
    </li>
    <li>
        put the modified files (tar'ed and gzip'ed) inside the patch tracker of
        the
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpmyadmin/" target="_blank">phpMyAdmin SourceForge account</a>.
    </li>

<h3>[8. Security ]</h3>

<a name="faq8_1"></a>
<h4>
    [<a href="#faq8_1">8.1</a>] Security alert, dated 2003-06-18.
</h4>
<p>
    Last update of this FAQ: 2003-07-22.
    <br /><br />
    The phpMyAdmin development team received notice of this security alert:
    <a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/325641" target="_blank">http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/325641.</a>
    <br /><br />

    The team regrets that the author did not communicate with us before
    sending this alert. However, here is our current reply to the points mentioned:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>&quot;Directory transversal attack&quot;
    <br /><br />

    This problem had been fixed in version 2.5.0, even if the author reports
    the 2.5.2 development version as vulnerable, which we could not reproduce.
    <br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>&quot;Remote local file retrieving&quot;
    <br /><br />
    This is a misleading title, as the author tells in his text:
    &quot;Note that you can't request files ( only dirs )&quot;.
    <br /><br />
    </li>

    <li>&quot;Remote internal directory listing&quot;
    <br /><br />
    It was possible to retrieve the list of phpMyAdmin's directory (which we
    doubt can cause any damage), but we fixed this in the
    2.5.2 version.
    <br /><br />
    </li>

    <li>&quot;XSS and Path disclosures&quot;
    <br /><br />
    Most of the XSS problems have been fixed in version 2.5.0. The rest
    have been fixed in the 2.5.2 version.
    <br /><br />
    We believe that the Path disclosures problems have also been fixed
    in version 2.5.2.
    <br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>&quot;Information encoding weakness&quot;
    <br /><br />
    We believe that an exploit for this weakness would be difficult
    to achieve.  However version 2.5.2 now encrypts the password
    with the well-known blowfish algorithm.
    <br /><br />
    </li>
</ul>

<a name="faq8_2"></a>
<h4>
    [<a href="#faq8_2">8.2</a>] Security alert, dated 2004-06-29.
</h4>
<p>
    Last update of this FAQ: 2004-06-30.
    <br /><br />
    The phpMyAdmin development team received notice of this security alert:
    <a href="http://securityfocus.com/archive/1/367486/2004-06-26/2004-07-02/0" target="_blank">http://securityfocus.com/archive/1/367486/2004-06-26/2004-07-02/0</a>
    <br /><br />
    We would like to put emphasis on the disappointment we feel when a
    bugreporter does not contact the authors of a software first, before
    posting any exploits. The common way to report this, is to give the
    developers a reasonable amount of time to respond to an exploit before
    it is made public.
    <br /><br />
    We acknowledge that phpMyAdmin versions 2.5.1 to 2.5.7 are vulnerable
    to this problem, if each of the following conditions are met:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
    The Web server hosting phpMyAdmin is not running in safe mode.
    </li>
    <li>
    In config.inc.php, <tt>$cfg['LeftFrameLight']</tt> is set to FALSE
    (the default value of this parameter is <tt>TRUE</tt>).
    </li>
    <li>
    There is no firewall blocking requests from the Web server to the
    attacking host.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <br />
    Version 2.5.7-pl1 was released with a fix for this vulnerability.

<h2>Developers Information</h2>

<p>
    phpMyAdmin is Open Source, so you're invited to contribute to it. Many
    great features have been written by other people and you too can help to
    make phpMyAdmin a useful tool.
</p>

<p>
    If you're planning to contribute source, please read the following
    information:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        All files include <i>libraries/header.inc.php</i> (layout),.
        <i>libraries/common.lib.php</i> (common functions) and
        <i>config.inc.php</i>.
        <br />
        Only configuration data should go in <i>config.inc.php</i>. Please keep
        it free from other code.
        <br />
        Commonly used functions should be added to
        <i>libraries/common.lib.php</i> and more specific ones may be added
        within a library stored into the <i>libraries</i> sub-directory.
    </li>
    <li>
        Obviously, you're free to use whatever coding style you want. But
        please try to keep your code as simple as possible: beginners are
        using phpMyAdmin as an example application.<br />
        As far as possible, we want the scripts to be XHTML1.0 and CSS2
        compliant on one hand, they fit the
        <a href="http://pear.php.net/" target="_blank">PEAR coding standards</a>
        on the other hand. Please pay attention to this.
    </li>
    <li>
        Please try to keep up the file-naming conventions. Table-related stuff
        goes to <i>tbl_*.php</i>, db-related code to <i>db_*.php</i>,
        server-related tools to <i>server_*.php</i> and so on.
    </li>
    <li>
        Please don't use verbose strings in your code, instead add the string
        (at least) to <i>english-iso-8859-1.inc.php</i> and print() it out.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you want to be really helpful, write an entry for the ChangeLog.
    </li>
    <li id="developersdbg">
        The DBG extension (<a href="http://dd.cron.ru/dbg/" target="_blank">PHP
          Debugger DBG</a>) is now supported by phpMyAdmin for developers to
        better debug and profile their code.<br />
        Please see the <tt>$cfg['DBG']*</tt> configuration options for more
        information.<br />
        This is in memoriam of the Space Shuttle Columbia (STS-107) which was

Original Credits of Version 2.1.0
---------------------------------

    This work is based on Peter Kuppelwieser's MySQL-Webadmin. It was his idea
    to create a web-based interface to MySQL using PHP3. Although I have not
    used any of his source-code, there are some concepts I've borrowed from
    him. phpMyAdmin was created because Peter told me he wasn't going to
    further develop his (great) tool.
    Thanks go to
    - Amalesh Kempf &lt;ak-lsml_at_living-source.com&gt; who contributed the
      code for the check when dropping a table or database. He also suggested
      that you should be able to specify the primary key on tbl_create.php3. To
      version 1.1.1 he contributed the ldi_*.php3-set (Import text-files) as
      well as a bug-report. Plus many smaller improvements.
    - Jan Legenhausen &lt;jan_at_nrw.net&gt;: He made many of the changes that
      were introduced in 1.3.0 (including quite significant ones like the
      authentication). For 1.4.1 he enhanced the table-dump feature. Plus
      bug-fixes and help.
    - Marc Delisle &lt;DelislMa_at_CollegeSherbrooke.qc.ca&gt; made phpMyAdmin
      language-independent by outsourcing the strings to a separate file. He
      also contributed the French translation.
    - Alexandr Bravo &lt;abravo_at_hq.admiral.ru&gt; who contributed
      tbl_select.php3, a feature to display only some fields from a table.
    - Chris Jackson &lt;chrisj_at_ctel.net&gt; added support for MySQL
      functions in tbl_change.php3. He also added the
      &quot;Query by Example&quot; feature in 2.0.
    - Dave Walton &lt;walton_at_nordicdms.com&gt; added support for multiple
      servers and is a regular contributor for bug-fixes.
    - Gabriel Ash &lt;ga244_at_is8.nyu.edu&gt; contributed the random access
      features for 2.0.6.
    The following people have contributed minor changes, enhancements, bugfixes
    or support for a new language:
    Jim Kraai, Jordi Bruguera, Miquel Obrador, Geert Lund, Thomas Kleemann,
    Alexander Leidinger, Kiko Albiol, Daniel C. Chao, Pavel Piankov,
    Sascha Kettler, Joe Pruett, Renato Lins, Mark Kronsbein, Jannis Hermanns,
    G. Wieggers.

    And thanks to everyone else who sent me email with suggestions, bug-reports
    and or just some feedback.
