Does WeebleFM support SFTP?
x-wfm-solution
The short answer to this no.
<P>SFTP requires a special client that is SFTP aware.  WeebleFM currently
 uses php4's built-in FTP functions (which are not SFTP aware).<BR>
 Using an FTP -> SFTP bridge (or proxy) to 'tunnel' the FTP connection
 should work fine.</P>
