- Added server response to bad-login.htm
- Added charset conversion (PHP 4.3 recommended)
- Once moved to PHPMailer, mails sent thru UM aren't in RBL filters by 'malformed headers'
- Moved to PHPMailer as mailer (without mods), since PHPMailer is stable, powerful and RFC-compliant
- Some cleanup on attachments download
- Fixed bug with special chars (ç specially)
- Per-server protocol/port configuration
- Attachment decoding rewrote, now all attachments are decoded once and all new requests are get from the cached file
- array_qsort2 rewrote, 80% of code reduction and no stack overflows
- Lot of fixes, better cache and line breaks handling

- $block_external_images now blocks backgrounds too (William Warner, Jr)
- Support for message/rfc822 (*.eml hell) attachments and it's sub-attachments (uff)
- Cleaned routines wich uses dates and timezone
- Changed timezone interval from 1 hour to 30 minutes in preferences
- Removed $server_time_zone from config.php, used date("Z") instead
- Added FILTERS!. At this momment, it's not available for end users
  A new file called apply_filters.php was added and contais a sample array wich can
  be uncommented to test filters. At this momment, only FL_TYPE_MOVE and FL_TYPE_DELETE are
  working. In addition, a new config key called $allow_filters was added to config.php and will
  enable and disable the filters. Please note. In order to keep my first idea, it's a CLIENT SIDE
  filter, and will not save your server's disk space until the user open him mailbox. Another
  problem is the response to client, because once a filter is processed, UM will refresh the
  message list again.
- Some changes in smtp_send() method to prevent errors in some cases :)
- Added $enable_cookies to "config.security.php" wich if enabled, will require also a cookie
  I believe this change will fix all security related problems, specially the 'Referer' problem
  If this option still turned off, a browser with no cookies still can use the webmail
- All security-related configurations was moved to "config.security.php"
- When in debug mode, redirections will be sent as a link in bottom of each page, it will stop the "Headers already sent" warning
