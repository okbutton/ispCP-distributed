Installing Preview Pane
=======================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
   Here is a example for the 1.0 version of the Preview Pane 
   plugin.

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -zxvf preview_pane-1.0-1.4.3.tar.gz

2) Patch the SquirrelMail source code to provide better 
   integration with this plugin.  This step is technically
   optional, however, it is strongly recommended, and is a
   very minor patch that can be done by hand if necessary.

   There are two ways to do this:

     A) This is the recommended method, which guarantees you will not
        lose any other changes you may have made to your SquirrelMail
        installation.  Change to the main SquirrelMail directory and
        patch your SquirrelMail source code for this plugin:

       $ cd ..
       $ patch -p0 < plugins/preview_pane/patches/preview_pane_squirrelmail-1.4.3.diff

        Note that if you have version 1.5.x, change that last command to use the
        correct .diff file.

        If the output of this command indicates any FAILUREs, you either
        need to update the patch utility on your system or you have some
        non-standard/modified SquirrelMail source code; we can work together
        to get your version patched - just send an email.

        Note for Windows users: you can get native patch functionality
        by installing this very useful package:
        http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/

     B) If you are certain you have an unmodified SquirrelMail installation
        or are having problems with the patch command above, you may use the
        provided pre-patched source file by running this command:

       $ cd ..
       $ cp plugins/preview_pane/source_files/read_body.php-squirrelmail-1.4.3 src/read_body.php
       cp: overwrite `src/read_body.php'? y

        Note that if you have version 1.5.x, change that last command to use the
        correct file.

3) If you are also running the Archive Mail plugin, you will need
   to patch or replace one of its files with what is included with this 
   plugin.

   There are two ways to do this (in this case, it might not be as important
   to run the patch as opposed to copying the file):

     A) Remaining in the main SquirrelMail directory, run the following command 
        to patch that plugin so it works with this one (make sure to use the
        patch file that corresponds to your version of the Archive Mail plugin):

       $ patch -p0 < plugins/preview_pane/patches/preview_pane_archive_mail_1-2_squirrelmail_1-4-x.diff

     B) Use the pre-patched file provided with this plugin (make sure to use
        the source file that corresponds to your version of the Archive Mail
        plugin):

       $ cp plugins/preview_pane/source_files/archive_mail_bottom.php-1.2 \
            plugins/archive_mail/includes/archive_mail_bottom.php
       cp: overwrite `plugins/archive_mail/includes/archive_mail_bottom.php'? y

4) You may optionally patch the "Delete/Move/Next" plugin such that clicking on 
   a "Delete & Prev" or "Delete & Next" link in the preview pane will correctly 
   refresh the message list.  Note that this is only necessary for SquirrelMail
   1.4.x, and NOT for 1.5.1 and up.

   Again, remain in the main SquirrelMail directory and run the following 
   command, making sure that you use the patch file that applies to your
   version of SquirrelMail:

  ----- optional -----
  $ patch -p0 < plugins/preview_pane/patches/preview_pane_delete_move_next_squirrelmail-1.4.3.diff
  ----- optional -----

5) Then go to your config directory and run conf.pl.  Choose
   option 8 and move the plugin from the "Available Plugins"
   category to the "Installed Plugins" category.  Save and exit.

  $ cd ../../config/
  $ ./conf.pl
