Installing the SmallCal Plugin
==============================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
Here is a example for the 0.7 version of the smallcal plugin.

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -xzvf smallcal-0.7-1.2.3.tar.gz

2) Then go to your config directory and run conf.pl.  Choose
   option 8 and move the plugin from the "Available Plugins"
   category to the "Installed Plugins" category.  Save and exit.

  $ cd ../config/
  $ ./conf.pl

3) Also, please verify that you have the "compatibility" plugin
   installed.
