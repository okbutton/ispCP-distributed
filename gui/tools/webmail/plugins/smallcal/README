SmallCal plugin for SquirrelMail
================================
Ver 0.8, 04/24/03

Original author: Nick Rosenberg <nick@dolphins-angels.com>
Expanded by:     Paul Lesneiwski <pdontthink@angrynerds.com>


Description
===========

This plugin provides a miniature calendar below the
folder list on the left side of the SquirrelMail interface.

It is an implementation of the calendar script at 
http://www.cascade.org.uk/software/php/calendar
by David Wilkinson with a few mods to make it work
with Squirrelmail.

NOTE: This script requires the calendar (or shared calendar)
module to work properly as the days link directly to it.

     ways to separate the calendar from the rest of the folder
     frame content (Thanks to Kurt Yoder <kyoder@shcorp.com>)
   * Updated for compatibility with new version reporting
     API
   * Attempted to add option to put calendar at bottom of left

     functions.php
