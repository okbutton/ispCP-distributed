Description
===========

This plugin includes the functionality of two plugins, which
are Quota Usage plugin and Disk Quota plugin.

It can retrieve the current quota usage from the IMAP 
server using the IMAP4 QUOTA extension.  It displays size-
based quotas and/or message-count quotas, as given by the IMAP
server. This function comes from Quota Usage plugin.

Also it can retrieve the current quota usage from UNIX quota
command for UNIX-quota based systems. It displays size-based
quotas and/or file-count quotas, as retreived from the quota
command. This function comes from Disk Quota plugin.

The quota can be displayed above or below the folder listing,
and optionally as a warning in the Message of the Day if the
user's quota is above a configurable "yellow" or "red" alert
level.

The plugin uses Flash, HTML or gd library graphics. You can
choose whichever you like.

For translating the plugin to your language, see the file
TRANSLATING.


Requirements
============

- IMAP server with QUOTA Extension support or UNIX based
  quotas enabled on the server filesystem.
- Quota set for user.  (if it's not set, nothing is displayed).
    NOTE:  Courier-IMAP may not report the quota if usage is 0%.  
           Try sending a message to the user if this is the case.
- Should work with versions of SquirrelMail as far back as 1.2.7 
  at least as well as version 1.5.1.  Please report problems and
  incompatibilities with these and other SquirrelMail versions.

The plugin was tested with Courier-IMAP 1.4.0 and Cyrus 2.2.10 and
above. If your IMAP server only deals with maildirquotas, you can
try UNIX-based quota checking for filesystem quotas.

One of the authors use it successfully with Vpopmail 5.1.4 and above,
a virtual domain package for Qmail. Also it is used with Postfix 2.1.5
and Cyrus 2.2.10 with no problems.


Installation
============

Please read the INSTALL file.

explained and found in the config.php file.
