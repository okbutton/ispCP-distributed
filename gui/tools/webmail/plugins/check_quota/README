Based on code by:

Support for cPanel quota functionality was inspired from code by:
Rob Thiesfield <php_hacker@samafas.com>.


Description
===========

This plugin will check and display users' mail quota status.  Current
and maximum quota usage is displayed in easy-to-read graphical format.
Optional warnings may also be displayed to users who are nearing their 
quota allocation when they log in (where the "Message Of The Day" would 
normally be displayed).

This plugin is compatible with three types of mail quota systems:

It can check UNIX (filesystem) quotas using the quota binary that is 
present on most modern UNIX/Linux or BSD based systems which have 
quota support enabled.  It will display both size-based and count-
based quotas.

It can check IMAP quotas using the IMAP4 QUOTA extension which will be
present on all modern IMAP servers which have IMAP quotas enabled.  It 
will display both size-based and count-based quotas.

It can also experimentally check cPanel quotas.  For this to work, it 
uses the "du" command, which is available in all modern UNIX/Linux or 
BSD based systems.  In this mode, the plugin will display size-based 
quotas only.

The quota information will be displayed above or below the folder 
listing and optionally as a warning in the MOTD ("Message of the Day") 
if the user has a usage which is above configurable "yellow" or "red" 
alert levels.

The plugin can use pure HTML tables, GD images or Flash when drawing 
quota graphs.  All graph types are compatible with "Check Quota Themes", 
from which there are several to choose.



License
=======

This plugin is released under the GNU General Public
License (see the file LICENSE for details).



Requirements
============

 * SquirrelMail 1.4.0 or above 

 * Compatibility plugin, version 2.0.7 or above

 * One of the following mail quota systems:

   - For UNIX (filesystem) quotas:
     A modern UNIX/Linux or BSD based operating system with 
     quota support.

   - For IMAP quotas:
     An IMAP server with QUOTA extension support.  If your IMAP 
     server uses maildir quotas, you can also try UNIX quota 
     checking instead of IMAP quotas, although it is much easier 
     to use the IMAP server's quota system instead of adding 
     more complexity.

   - For cPanel quotas:
     A modern UNIX/Linux or BSD based operating system with 
     cPanel installed and PHP version 4.3.0 or above (4.3.3 
     if using Windows).

 * Quotas must be properly set and configured for your users 
   (if not set, no quota information will be reported and thus 
   no quota graph can be displayed).
   NOTE:  Courier-IMAP may not report properly-configured quotas 
          if usage is 0%.  Try first sending a message to the 
          user if this is the case.



Installation
============

Please read the INSTALL file.



Configuration
=============

There are many configuration items, although some of them are optional 
and many of them are only required for certain mail quota system types.
The INSTALL file includes detailed help for configuring this plugin, 
and the configuration file itself is also well documented.



Translation
===========

If this plugin is not translated to your language, please help translate 
it.  For translation information, please read the TRANSLATING file.



Themes Support
==============

Check Quota 2.0 introduced a themes system for the quota usage graphs.  
These themes work just like the SquirrelMail theme files.  If there is
a file in the check_quota/themes directory that matches the name of the
SquirrelMail theme being used, that file will be used to adapt the quota
display graph to match the SquirrelMail theme.

Currently, not all SquirrelMail themes have analogues in the Check Quota
themes directory.  If you create a new theme for Check Quota, please submit
them for inclusion in the next plugin release.



Help Requests
=============

First, remember that this plugin does NOT generate any of the quota
information or functionality itself.  Your mail system must already
have a fully functioning quota system BEFORE you install this plugin.

Before asking for help, did you enable the "troubleshoot" functionality
in the configuration file?  Don't ask for help without the information
given by the Troubleshooting page.

Help requests are welcome to my personal address but please post your
problems to the SquirrelMail Plugins mailing list first.  There you may get
faster help from more people and it will be a starting point for those who
may have the same problems as yours.

Info about the SquirrelMail Plugins mailing list can be found on the
SquirrelMail web site.  It is currently located at:

http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/squirrelmail-plugins



TODO
====

 * Synchronize theme system with 1.5.2+ templating system
 * Various FIXME items noted in the code



Change Log
==========

The Change Log can be found in the file CHANGELOG.
