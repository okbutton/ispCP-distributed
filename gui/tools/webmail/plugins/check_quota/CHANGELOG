- Updated internationalization - please submit all translations to the
  SquirrelMail i18n team from now on.

================
- Added remote UNIX quota checking capability. config.php has changed,
  please update your config.php to be able to use the new version.

  stable.
- Simplified IMAP functions a little, and changed them to be compatible
  with the class structure.
- Added experimental cPanel quota support.
- Plugin text outputs fully support SquirrelMail themes now.
- Added Check Quota themes. If there is a theme file with the same name as
  the current SquirrelMail theme file the user is using in the themes
  directory of Check Quota, all quota graphs will use the colors for that
  theme.
- Rewritten GD image drawing from scratch. It can output all alert levels
  with different colors now. Also it is Check Quota themes compatible.

  which user mails are kept and hide others to avoid confusion.
- Changed some configuration options to be compatible with the new
  troubleshooting page.
- Removed some unnecessary and repeating configuration options.
- Removed repetitions in the functions. Most of the functions were
  simplified to have faster operation.
- Removed all errors, warnings and notices.

- Updated Turkish (tr_TR) language files.
- Old language files are incompatible with this release, so I had to remove
  them. I hope you will send me updated language files.
