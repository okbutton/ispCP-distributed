Change Log for Disk Quota
=========================

Jan 23, 2004 - version 3.1.1
- The swf files had a strange problem which seems to be happening from
  a bug in Flash. That is if quota and the limit had a difference of
  multiplies of 10 (5000 and 10000 for example) the red line was not being
  drawn. Now it is corrected. Thanks to Eldon Rosenberg for his help on
  identifying this issue.
- Added Portuguese translations by Tiago Augusto Wegner.

Nov 18, 2003 - version 3.1
- Added a new variable to show aliases instead of filesystem names.
  With this, the administrator can configure what the users will see
  for the filesystem name. An example is showing "Mail Folder" instead
  of "/dev/hda4". Thanks to Paul McAvoy for his help on this addition.
- Fixed small problems on the flash movies.
- Added Spanish translations by Carlos Francisco Castillo. (Dec 17, 2003)

Nov 10, 2003 - version 3.0.3
- Fixed some problems with the configuration where SM and IMAP are
  on different machines.
- Added small cosmetic corrections to config.php
- Thanks to Eldon Rosenberg for his feedback about these problems
  (Eldon, I replied to your message but you are using spamlist.org which
  blacklists our complete country!)
- This is the day our great leader Mustafa Kemal Ataturk passed away in 1938.
  We remember his presence with all our respect...

Nov 04, 2003 - version 3.0.2
- Fixed a bug where the filesystem name was too long causing the
  quota information of the user to be shown on a second line.
- Removed the restrictions on localising the strings.
- Fixed minor bugs. 
- Added Catalan translations by Marc Revenga.
- Removed the Spanish translations by Carlos Francisco Castillo as they
  were not the translations of 3.x branch. I hope Carlos sends 3.x
  translations in the future.
- Thanks to Tomas Kuliavas for his comments about translation problems.

Oct 20, 2003 - version 3.0.1
- Fixed a bug where I wrote a variable name wrong, so the plugin
  broke on some systems.
- Fixed some minor issues with Flash movies.
- Added the option to show or hide the details link again.
- Added Spanish localisations by Carlos Francisco Castillo.
- Added more modifications to make the plugin more compliant to
  the Plugin Standards of SquirrelMail.

Oct 16, 2003 - version 3.0
- Now, we are on a new branch that incorporates Flash!
- Thanks to Mike Smith for his work in my absence.
- Cleaned up so much php code that, this is a nearly
  brand-new plugin now.
- The bar on the left pane is now a Flash movie.
- The details page has been changed also into a Flash movie and has an
  interactive help display no quota plugin ever had for more user friendliness.
- Most of the unnecessary options have been removed and has fewer
  but more productive options now.
- It is much more easy to install because the number of its pages have decreased.
- Tested on FreeBSD, should work on Linux but I am not sure about Solaris
  because the quota binaries behave differently on these operating systems.
  You are welcome to test and send feedback :-)
- Modified to comply with "http://squirrelmail.org/wiki/wiki.php?PluginStandards"
  so that SquirrelMail developers don't get into trouble :-)
- Probably requires Flash Player 6 or better (May work with Flash 5 but I am not sure).
- When SquirrelMail and IMAP server are on different machines, because of a PHP bug in 4.3.2 and 4.3.3,
  the plugin (all versions) doesn't work for now. That should be solved in a new PHP release. Until then
  we don't have different machines support.

Apr 11, 2003 - version 2.6.5 ( mike@ftl.com )
- Bug with showing details with version 1.4+ (fixed)

Apr 10, 2003 - version 2.6.4 ( mike@ftl.com )
- Improves the look of the bar graph.
  Thanks go out to Ron Nash (nash@rohan.sdsu.edu) for the update.
- Look for a rewrite soon :)

Jan 10, 2003 - version 2.6.3 ( mike@ftl.com )
- Promlem with broken images now fixed. 
  $_SESSION['prefs_cache']['left_size'] was only being set if you changed
  'Width of Folder List' under 'Folder Preferences'. Thanks to Ken Gilmour
  for bringing this to my attention.

Dec, 26, 2002 - version 2.6.2 ( mike@ftl.com )
- Small error in left_quota.php when array didn't exist. Thanks Jeroen.

Dec, 16, 2002 - version 2.6.1 ( mike@ftl.com )
- DOH! Little Divide by zero error in the HTML graph. Thanks Serge.
- Added an alt tag to the GD image to show more verbose usage.

Dec, 13, 2002 - version 2.6.0 ( mike@ftl.com )
- Bumbed the version number so we have a clean start for the GD tree.
- Added support for GD.
- Cleaned up some code in left_quota.php.
- I've only tested this on Linux. 

Nov, 27, 2002 - version 2.5.1
- Added SM's index.php to document root of the plugin for
  redirection.
- Added transparent background to OK.png and EXCEED.png
  (Thanks to Rob Speicher for sending me the new pngs. :-)

Nov, 19, 2002 - version 2.5
- Now has an option in options.php to work with 1.3.x branch or
  older versions. So this solves incompatibility with 1.3.x
  branch.
- Removed the unneeded inclusion of imap.php

Nov, 14, 2002 - version 2.4
- The quota binary on modern linux systems give a different output for
  users that don't have quota limit. So, the left_quota.php gave a
  "Divide by zero" error. Now that you can set a variable named
  $dq_strange_binary for the plugin to run on these systems correctly.
- Also the check_quota.php doesn't show EXCEEDED image for non-quota
  users on these systems.
- Thanks to Uwe S. Fuerst and Patrick Kwan for sending this bug to me.
 
Nov, 13, 2002 - version 2.3.1
- Completely rewritten the code for HTML 4.0 compatibility and simplicity.
- Everything needs to be configured for once (not four times :-) now in a
  new file named options.php
- Added a lot of options to options.php like verbose showing, filesystem showing
  etc. Experiment yourself a little bit.
- Added a very detailed INSTALL file.
- Thanks to my three beta testers, who gave me lots of support and ideas.

Nov, 11, 2002 - version 2.1.1
- Displays your disk quota usage as graph under the folders link now. Also has
  changed the "Check Quota" link to "Details".
- If the user has no quota limitation, the plugin will not break and say
  "You have no limitations" to the user.

Nov, 11, 2002 - version 2.0.2
- Minor language fixes and nbsp; fixes.

Oct, 31, 2002 - version 2.0
- I have changed the code for better handling on most platforms and
  also now you can have your mail and web servers seperate. Plugin works
  on different servers without problems.
- Also localised the plugin with disk_quota.po (Kerem)
- Good luck on your thesis Claudio :-)
