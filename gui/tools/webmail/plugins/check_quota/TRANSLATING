Translating Check Quota
=======================

Before translating the Check Quota plugin, see translating.txt 
in the SquirrelMail doc directory, which will help you understand 
how the SquirrelMail translation system works.

To translate Check Quota, you will need to edit the file named
check_quota.pot.  If this file is missing, please download the
plugin again from the SquirrelMail website.

Edit the check_quota.pot file with your favorite text editor and 
fill in the msgstr lines according to the msgid strings.  Also, 
you have to change the CHARSET at the top of the file to match the 
character set that your language uses.

Now you need to place the translated .pot file in the SquirrelMail
locale directory for your language.  You can find the four digit code 
for your locale at this page:

http://lcweb.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/langhome.html

Using the Turkish (tr_TR) locale as an example (assuming you are
currently located in the check_quota plugin directory):

  $ mv check_quota.pot ../../locale/tr_TR/LC_MESSAGES/check_quota.po

Note that you have now renamed the file as a .po file.

The last step is to compile your translation.  Change to your locale
directory and use the following command:

  $ cd ../../locale/tr_TR/LC_MESSAGES
  $ msgfmt -o check_quota.mo check_quota.po

Your translation is complete.  Switch to your locale from the Display
Preferences in SquirrelMail and test your translations.  If your
translations do not appear to be working and you are using Apache as 
your web server, try restarting it, because sometimes strings are 
cached.

The community would be grateful if you would then send your translation
to the SquirrelMail internationalization mailing list for inclusion in
the SquirrelMail locales package: 

  squirrelmail-i18n@lists.sourceforge.net

Thanks for your help.
