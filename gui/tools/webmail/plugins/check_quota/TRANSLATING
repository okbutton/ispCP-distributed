Translating Check Quota
=======================

Before translating the plugin see translating.txt
in SquirrelMail docs, that will help you understand
what is needed better.

To translate the plugin, first you need to create
the strings template for the plugin. There is a file
named createpot in the check_quota directory for
template creation. All you need to do is to execute
that file and create the check_quota.pot file:

$ chmod 755 createpot
$ ./createpot

Edit the check_quota.pot file and fill in the
msgstr parts according to msgid parts. Now you need to
enter the locale directory and create your locale
directories. I will give Turkish (tr_TR) locale as an
example:

$ cd locale
$ mkdir tr_TR
$ cd tr_TR
$ mkdir LC_MESSAGES
$ cd ../../

You can find the four digit code for your locale at this
page:

http://lcweb.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/langhome.html

Now move the check_quota.pot file to the last directory
you created and rename it as check_quota.po

$ mv check_quota.pot locale/tr_TR/LC_MESSAGES/check_quota.po

Last thing you have to do is creating the check_quota.mo file
so that SquirrelMail will recognise our translation.

$ cd locale/tr_TR/LC_MESSAGES
$ msgfmt -o check_quota.mo check_quota.po

Your translation is complete. Switch to your locale from
Display Preferences in SquirrelMail and test your translations.
If your translations do not appear to be working and you are
using Apache as your webserver, try restarting it, because
sometimes strings are cached.

We will be very happy if you send your translations to us so
we can include them in the next release of the plugin.
