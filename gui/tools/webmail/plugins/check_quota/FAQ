ANSWERS

1. I use Courier-IMAP with the user quota set, but nothing shows up.

    A: The "QUOTA" capability is not listed in the configuration file by 
    default.  To turn this on, add "QUOTA" in the CAPABILITY directive 
    of /usr/lib/courier-imap/etc/imapd, then restart the imap server.

    NOTE: Courier-IMAP will NOT report a quota if usage is 0%.  If you believe
    you have it setup correctly, try sending a message to the user, then 
    check again.

2. When using UNIX quotas, the plugin does not show anything.

   If you are using UNIX quotas and cannot see quota information for your
   account, check your quota output from a command shell using the command:

  $ quota -v your_username

   If you do not have any quota or limit set, the plugin will not show
   anything. Set a quota and limit for your account and you should be able
   to see the quota information via the plugin.
