1. I use Courier-IMAP with the user quota set, but nothing shows up.

   The "QUOTA" capability may not be listed in the configuration file 
   by default.  To turn this on, make sure that "QUOTA" is in the 
   CAPABILITY configuration setting inside /usr/lib/courier-imap/etc/imapd, 
   then restart the IMAP server.

   NOTE: Courier-IMAP may NOT report a quota if usage is 0%.  If you
   believe that you have it setup correctly, try sending a message to the
   user, then check again.

2. When using UNIX quotas, the plugin does not show anything.

   If you are using UNIX quotas and cannot see quota information for your
   account, check your quota output from a command shell using the command:

   $ quota -v your_username

   If you do not have any quota or limit set, the plugin will not show
   anything.  Set a quota and limit for your account and you should be able
   to see the quota information via the plugin.

3. When using cPanel quotas, the plugin does not show anything.

   You probably did not set your cPanel root variable correctly in the
   config.php file.  Also, the quota file for your domain may not be world
   readable.  You may want to change that file's permissions to be able to
   check this type of quotas.

4. Why doesn't the plugin show any output when quota is not set?

   This is because it will not have any number to compare to your usage.  So
   it will not be able to check if you have exceeded your quota, or it will
   not be able to draw any graphs.
