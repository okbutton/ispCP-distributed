
Login Auto Plugin
aka "The Plugin formerly know as Auto Login"
By Jay Guerette <JayGuerette@pobox.com>
v1.1 (c) 2003 (GNU GPL - see ../../COPYING)

This plugin saves the username and/or password by encrypted persistent cookie.

The encryption uses a random XOR technique, MD5, and a private key. It's
portable without relying on the MCRYPT library; it's also fairly strong. Take
a look at the code. It's nifty.

Once installed, you will need to edit/look at 'config.php.sample' in 
the 'login_auto' plugin directory. At the very least you should change the
encryption key and copy the file to 'config.php'.

A 'signout' will erase the cookies.

If you enable the security document link in the config file, and want to use
the included 'security.php' file, make sure you put it someplace accessible,
and update the url in the config file.

Please contact me with any questions or problems.

v0.2 (beta)
Changed name from auto_login to login_auto, because Tyler Akins scares me.
... Ok, actually, he had a good idea, and hey, it's beta, I can do that.
Can handle multiple encryption keys, as many as you want! Go paranoia!
Clears the cookies if the login fails, so you can login normally.
Forgets your username properly if you uncheck the remember username box.
