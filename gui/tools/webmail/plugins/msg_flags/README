Description
===========

This plugin/modification provides several visual enhancements for the
SquirrelMail interface, such as using small envelope icons to indicate
new and read messages, as well as which messages have been replied to,
forwarded, etc.  The folder list also has a few icons added to it.

Additionally, this plugin adds functionality that allows users to flag
their messages (by adding "Flag"/"Unflag" buttons to the message list
screen).

PLEASE NOTE that this plugin comes integrated with SquirrelMail as of
version 1.5.0, and should not be installed separately therein.

90/22/04 - ver 1.4.3.1
- Fixed README
- Fixed tarball naming
- Added space between icons and text in folder list
- Cleaned up code, removed Windows formatting
- Fixed patch file, now substantially smaller

01/06/04 - ver 1.4.3
- Updated the plugin for SM 1.4.3 stable.
- Folders have graphical images now.
- All text strings are ready for localization.

09/07/03 - ver 1.0.2
- Updated the plugin for SM 1.4.1 stable.
- Finally included a diff patch to apply the changes. Thnx Paul ;-)
- Removed old images dir.

07/03/03 - ver 1.0.1
- Reduced the image size a little, they have a fixed width and height now which should improve speed a little
  when loading the page.

07/03/03 - ver 1.0
- Updated the plugin for SM 1.4 stable.
- New Images! Thnx to Joris Bruring. The old (smaller size) images are also included.
- Thnx to Paul Kremer for sending me de modified files for 1.4 stable. Saved me some time :-)

20/03/03 - ver 0.9
- I finally updated the plugin to work with SM 1.4.0rc2a :-)
- Removed the setup.php and moved the code into move_messages.php.
- Sorry for not updating for a long time. I was very busy with school but i finally got my Bachalor's Degree :-)

17/09/02 - ver 0.8
- I updated the plugin to work with SM 1.2.8 and it works with the register_globals set to off.
- Note! If you're using a version before SM 1.2.8 there is no reason to upgrade this plugin.

26/06/02 - ver 0.7
- I updated the plugin to work with SM 1.2.7.
  First off all, my desktop died :-( so i had to work on my server and that delayed
  the work on Msg_Flags. But here it is :-)
- If you're using SM 1.2.6 there is no reason to upgrade this plugin since it's the same
  except the code might be a little different.
- The SM 1.2.7 tarball has the + and - images included in the image dir. This version of the 
  plugin uses them. If they're missing for some reason then copy the + and - img from the 
  Msg_flags dir to the SM image dir.

14/06/02 - ver 0.6
- After 1816 downloads someone noticed that the priority images were wrong.
  High prio was shown with a low prio image and low prio with the high prio image.
  Anyway this is what's fixed in this verion. If you are upgrading from ver 0.5 
  you can simply copy the mailbox_display.php from the archive since the rest is still the same.
  
08/05/02 - ver 0.5
- Folder collapse wouldn't work after installing msg_flags 0.4, sorry for that, this version fixes it.

08/05/02 - ver 0.4
- I had a bug reported and noticed that the case5 wasn't the same as included in SM 1.2.6
  So i took the fresh mailbox_display.php and move_messages.php from the SM 1.2.6 src and 
  modified these, so hopefully no more bugs now.
- Replaced the + and - in the folder list with images.
- Modified the envelope images. They now have the same width for better vertical alignment.
 
07/05/02 - ver 0.3
- Moved the envelope icon to the flags cell instead of the subject line cell.
- Aligned the flags cell LEFT
- If a flag is not set a transparent image of the same width is placed instead to 
  align the flags vertically.
- Updated README -> Do it your self instructions.

02/05/02 - ver 0.2
- Updated readme for SM 1.2.6
- Added mailbox_display.php and move_messages.php for SM 1.2.6
- Removed mailbox_display.php and move_messages.php for SM 1.2.5
