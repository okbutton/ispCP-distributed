Message Flags & Icons plugin for SquirrelMail
=============================================
Ver 1.4.3.1, 01/06/04


Original author: Robert Jaakke <robert@jaakke.com>


Description
===========

This plugin/modification provides several visual enhancements for the
SquirrelMail interface, such as using small envelope icons to indicate
new and read messages, as well as which messages have been replied to,
forwarded, etc.  The folder list also has a few icons added to it.

Additionally, this plugin adds functionality that allows users to flag
their messages (by adding "Flag"/"Unflag" buttons to the message list
screen).

PLEASE NOTE that this plugin comes integrated with SquirrelMail as of
version 1.5.0, and should not be installed separately unless you are
asking for trouble.



Installation
============

  1.  Change to the plugins directory.

        $ cd plugins/

  2.  Unarchive the plugin.

        $ tar zxvf /your/path/to/msg_flags-x.x.tgz

  3.  This should create a msg_flags/ directory under plugins.  Change 
      into that directory.

        $ cd msg_flags

  4.  There are 2 ways to to apply the changes.  Choose one of the
      following:
  
      a. Copy the source files provided herein directly.  BEWARE
         that you will lose any other source changes you may have
         made, as well as create conflicts if you use a CVS 
         version of SquirrelMail. 

         Copy the modified mailbox_display.php to the functions dir.
         Copy move_messages.php and left_main.php to the src dir.

        $ cp functions/mailbox_display.php ../../functions
        $ cd src/move_messages.php ../../src
        $ cd src/left_main.php ../../src
         

      b. Patch the source code by running the following command 
         from the the msg_flags directory:
      
        $ patch -p0 < ./msg_flags-squirrelmail-1.4.3a.diff
	 
	 There is a patch command that will do the same thing for Windows in
	 this very handy toolkit: http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/

Revision history
=======================

09/04/02 - ver 0.1
- initial release

02/05/02 - ver 0.2
- Updated readme for SM 1.2.6
- Added mailbox_display.php and move_messages.php for SM 1.2.6
- Removed mailbox_display.php and move_messages.php for SM 1.2.5

07/05/02 - ver 0.3
- Moved the envelope icon to the flags cell instead of the subject line cell.
- Aligned the flags cell LEFT
- If a flag is not set a transparent image of the same width is placed instead to 
  align the flags vertically.
- Updated README -> Do it your self instructions.

08/05/02 - ver 0.4
- I had a bug reported and noticed that the case5 wasn't the same as included in SM 1.2.6
  So i took the fresh mailbox_display.php and move_messages.php from the SM 1.2.6 src and 
  modified these, so hopefully no more bugs now.
- Replaced the + and - in the folder list with images.
- Modified the envelope images. They now have the same width for better vertical alignment.
 
08/05/02 - ver 0.5
- Folder collapse wouldn't work after installing msg_flags 0.4, sorry for that, this version fixes it.

14/06/02 - ver 0.6
- After 1816 downloads someone noticed that the priority images were wrong.
  High prio was shown with a low prio image and low prio with the high prio image.
  Anyway this is what's fixed in this verion. If you are upgrading from ver 0.5 
  you can simply copy the mailbox_display.php from the archive since the rest is still the same.
  
26/06/02 - ver 0.7
- I updated the plugin to work with SM 1.2.7.
  First off all, my desktop died :-( so i had to work on my server and that delayed
  the work on Msg_Flags. But here it is :-)
- If you're using SM 1.2.6 there is no reason to upgrade this plugin since it's the same
  except the code might be a little different.
- The SM 1.2.7 tarball has the + and - images included in the image dir. This version of the 
  plugin uses them. If they're missing for some reason then copy the + and - img from the 
  Msg_flags dir to the SM image dir.

17/09/02 - ver 0.8
- I updated the plugin to work with SM 1.2.8 and it works with the register_globals set to off.
- Note! If you're using a version before SM 1.2.8 there is no reason to upgrade this plugin.

20/03/03 - ver 0.9
- I finally updated the plugin to work with SM 1.4.0rc2a :-)
- Removed the setup.php and moved the code into move_messages.php.
- Sorry for not updating for a long time. I was very busy with school but i finally got my Bachalor's Degree :-)

07/03/03 - ver 1.0
- Updated the plugin for SM 1.4 stable.
- New Images! Thnx to Joris Bruring. The old (smaller size) images are also included.

07/03/03 - ver 1.0.1
