Installing Message Flags & Icons
================================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
   Here is a example for the 1.4.10 version of the Message
   Flags plugin.

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -zxvf msg_flags-1.4.10-1.4.3.tar.gz

2) Change into the msg_flags plugin directory and patch your 
   SquirrelMail source code.  Make sure you use the patch file 
   that pertains to your version of SquirrelMail or the most
   recent patch file if one for your version hasn't been added yet.

  $ cd msg_flags
  $ patch -p0 < patches/msg_flags-squirrelmail-1.4.20.diff

   Note for Windows users: you can get native patch functionality
   by installing this very useful package:
   http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/

3) (Optional: the only reason to do this is for use with the Plugin
   Updates plugin) Then go to your config directory and run conf.pl.  
   Choose option 8 and move the plugin from the "Available Plugins"
   category to the "Installed Plugins" category.  Save and exit.

  ----- optional -----
  $ cd ../../config/
  $ ./conf.pl
  ----- optional -----

4) Also, if not being used with SquirrelMail 1.4.10+ or 1.5.2+,
   please verify that you have the "Compatibility" plugin
   installed (but not necessarily activated).

5) Translations are not included in this package.  To get a
   translation, download the language pack needed from:
