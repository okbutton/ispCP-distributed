        You will need to provide more information than this.
                <p>
                First, check the "Tested On:" section, below, and see
                if your configuration looks like it should work (focus on
                PHP Version, SM version).
                <p>
                Often, installation problems have been resolved by upgrading SM,
                PHP, Apache, etc.  There are good security and functionality reasons
                to upgrade to more modern version in most cases as well.
                <p>
                Next, take a look at the specific error messages the plugin is
                giving you.  The development team has made an effort to provide error
                messages that can assist you in diagnosing your problem.
                <p>
                If you still can't figure it out, see the contact information below.
                If you write to the development team about a problem, please include
                as much information about your configuration and the exact error you
                are receiving as possible.

echo <<<TILLEND
                The "using insecure memory" warning is a gpg issue, not a plugin problem.
                When gpg is installed incorrectly, it can use insecure memory (a non-locked
                page file) and there exists a possibility that the memory block allocated by
                gpg can be written to the disk on swap, potentially leaving keys,
                passphrase, or plaintext in an insecure swap file.  On Unix, making the gpg
                binary setuid root may remove this warning.  Some Linux distributions
                distribute gpg in a non-setuid root form, probably mistakenly thinking that
                it will be more secure to not have the gpg binary be setuid root.

        Fatal error: Call to undefined function: check_php_version()
<UL>
                The GPG plugin requires a function from Squirrelmail called check_php_version.
                This function was added to the SM core code in version 1.2.9. If you are
                receiving this error, you are probably using a version of SM prior to 1.2.9
                You have two options:
<P>
                Upgrade Squirrelmail to a more recent version.
<UL>
                        This is the preferred option because all versions of Squirrelmail
                        prior to 1.2.11 have a remotely exploitable cross site scripting
                        security vulnerability.
</UL>
                Hack the check_php_version() function into your version of Squirrelmail.
<UL>
                        The check_php_version function is very small.
                        You could patch it into your version of Squirrelmail.
                        Put the following in your src/load_prefs.php file

    About Decryption
<ul>
    <p>
        Once you have uploaded a secret key or keyring, the decryption part of the
        plugin will be activated.  The plugin will try to automatically determine
        when a message contains OpenPGP/GPG encrypted content.  When the plugin
        detects a message that appears to have encrypted content, the
        'Decrypt Message Now' button will be displayed.  Because of the complexity
        of this feature, it is possible that the plugin may not always correctly
        identify a message that contains encrypted content.  Please report any
        unusual behavior, so that we can work with you to resolve your issue and
        patch the plugin.
</ul>
    About Signing
<ul>
    <p>
        Once you have uploaded a secret key or keyring, you need to select a signing
        key. Once you have selected a signing key, the signing portion of the plugin
        will become activated.  The 'Encrypt & Sign Now' and 'Sign on Send' buttons
        will display in the Compose window of Squirrelmail.  You should now be able
        to sign mail with your signing key.
</ul>
        gpg: secret key not imported (use --allow-secret-key-import to allow for it)
<UL>
                If you are using gpg v 1.0.5 or 1.0.6 you may see this message
                upon attempting to upload a private key/keyring.
     <p>
                Thanks to Derek Battams for reporting this issue.
     <p>
                Upgrading to a newer version of gpg will resolve this problem.
     <p>
                The development team has applied a patch for this issue, so
                hopefully no one will ever see this error.<br>
                Full details are available at:<br>
                <A HREF="http://www.braverock.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=16">http://www.braverock.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=16</A>

        pgp/mime support
<UL>
                The plugin currently has limited support for messages encoded
                with mime type 'application/pgp'
    <p>
                The plugin will correctly identify and verify signatures inside
                mime parts and decrypt messages in mime attachments.
    <p>
                The support still isn't perfect.  I can't figure out how to get
                Squirrelmail 1.2.11 to display the mime attachments in the browser window.
                That isn't precisely a plugin issue, I'll have to investigate how SM
                handles mime attachments, and figure out if there is any why to get SM 1.2.11
                to display the mime parts.
    <p>
                Mime attachments display in SM 1.4, but not in SM 1.2.11.  I think this is
                just the way SM is, and we aren't going to be able to affect that.
    <p>
                The development team will work to resolve this issue in a
                future release.  Any information on anomalous behavior, or
                suggested patches, would be appreciated.<br>

        Encrypt fails on SM 1.4.0 &amp; IE 6 or Netscape 7
<UL>
                Javascript Error: "The object does not support that property or method"
                          "Error: Error:'this.form.action' is null or not an object"
                These errors are caused by a bug in the released version
                of SM 1.4.0.  SM 1.4.0 uses a reserved word 'action' to name
                a hidden field.  This interferes with the plugin's use
                of the Javascript this.form.action to redirect the submit
                when the user presses 'Encrypt Now'.
<p>
                This error will only occur on browsers that do strict form checking
                of the DOM before executing the this.form.action command,
                principally some versions of IE 6 and Netscape 7.
<p>
                The Squirrelmail core team is aware of this issue, and expects to
                apply the patch to SM 1.4.1.
<p>
                The only solution to this issue in SM 1.4.0 is to patch
                compose.php (and optionally read_body.php) to change the
                hidden field 'action' to a name that is not a reserved word.

                The error you are seeing indicates that the signing javascript
                was unable to pull the body text from the Compose page and was added
                for just this kind of circumstance.
<p>
                Users who experienced problems similar to this one with Signing
                from IE 6 have been able to resolve it by updating to the newest
                Microsoft IE Service Pack and JScript engine, which should be
                available from Windows Update.
<p>
                Updating IE is probably the best we can offer right now. If you update
                IE and still experience this problem, please contact us, as several
                members of the development team use IE as thier primary environment,
                and we would be happy to help you resolve your issue.
<p>
                If there is an IE JScript wizard out there who can figure out
                why this is flaky, we'd love to hear about it.

        gpg: Oops: keyid_from_fingerprint: no pubkey
<UL>
                From and old post to the gpg devel list:
                When you delete a key with ownertrust set it does not disappear
                from the trustdb.  I mentioned this one a few months ago and I
                think it was concluded to be a feature and not a bug, though I
                still think that if I delete a key there should be no remnants of
                that key left behind.  The more significant problem is if there is
                an ultimately trusted key that gets deleted, then gpg will complain
                constantly:<br>
                gpg: Oops: keyid_from_fingerprint: no pubkey<br>
                and whenever --update-trustdb or --check-trustdb is run:<br>
                gpg: public key of ultimately trusted key 00000000 not found<br>

                Clicking on "Blocking popups" in the toolbar will toggle it to
                "Site popups allowed." However, the delay will still be present.
                This is appears to be normal for the Google Toolbar and not a bug
                in the GPG Plugin.
