WHAT IS THIS?

This is a simple plugin that, when installed, shows the quota
usage of the user logged in to SquirrelMail. It uses the *nix
quota binary to get information about the user's quota.

It has two functions:

1. Shows the disk usage of the user as a bar graph on the left
pane under folders list.
2. Can show the detailed quota information of the user on the
main window.

The "quota" binary must be setuid.
