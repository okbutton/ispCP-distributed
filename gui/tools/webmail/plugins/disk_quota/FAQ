FAQ

Q. Why quota-binary should be setuided?
A. Apache need to know the user-quota. Usually only root can see
   the quota for any user! But if you want Apache to retrive that
   data, he must be able to query the quota-db for any logged user.

Q. Is there a way it works without the setuid on quota?
A. Yes. See "SECOND WAY", suggest by Jakub Grygiel up in this file.
   One more way could be this: let httpd run as root! (GULP! DO NOT!)

Q. What's the risk with a setuided quota on my system?
A. Any user will be able to see the other's user quota. It's a
   privacy-related matter.

Q. I changed the owner of quota binary. Why it still does't work?
A. Even if you chown the quota binary, The user running httpd will
   not be able to use the quota-database because it's only readable
   by root...

Q. Oh hell... so what I could do for my user's privacy?
A. I have a great server with apache+php+uw_imap. Users can only
   login via IMAPs or HTTPs: it's a MAIL-SERVER! In this way it's
   safe to setuid the quota-binary. In other words, each user have
   shell=/bin/false, and any telnet/ssh/rsh (etc.etc.) service is
   stricly closed.

Q. What's the SM version you tested this plugin on?
A. I'm running SM-1.4.2 at the moment and disk_quota-3.1.1 on
   FreeBSD 4.8 with Apache 2.0.48 / PHP 4.3.3

Q. Is there a way to not allow users to use php scripts
   in their www directory?
A. Yes. I didn't test it, but Jakub Grygiel (kubas@kul.lublin.pl)
   send me an email with this hint:
	>
	> just create .htaccess file in user's www directory
	>
	> chmod 444 .htaccess
	>
	> put the following line to .htaccess file:
	> php_flag engine off
	>
	> I that it's security by obscurity but it works...
	>
   I wish to thank Jakub for his suggestions :-)

Q. I cannot run disk-quota plugin on my Solaris, BSD and RedHat
   system simply changing permission, is there another way?
A. Of course. If the 2 ways I suggested won't work, you can try
   using "sudo". For example, on Solaris you must add
     nobody        ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/lib/fs/ufs/quota
   into /etc/sudoers. This should fix the problem!
   Many many thanks to Harry Yu and Andrzej Wojkowski  for this
   useful indication! :-)
