Installing HTML Mail Plugin
===========================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
   Here is a example for the 1.0 version of the html_mail plugin.

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -zxvf html_mail-1.0-1.4.tar.gz

2) If you do not need to change the default plugin settings,
   skip to the next step.  Otherwise, change into the html_mail 
   directory, copy config.php.sample to config.php and edit 
   config.php, making adjustments as you deem necessary.

  $ cd html_mail
  $ cp config.php.sample config.php
  $ vi config.php

3) If you have SquirrelMail version 1.4.2 or higher, skip to 
   step 4.  Otherwise, you need to patch the SquirrelMail 
   source code.  Do so from the html_mail directory:

  $ patch -p0 < patches/squirrelmail-1.4-html_mail.diff

   Make sure that you use the patch file that matches your
   SquirrelMail version.

   Note for Windows users: you can get native patch functionality
   by installing this very useful package:
   http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/

4) If will be using the FCKeditor engine, or you do not wish to 
   provide emoticon functionality, skip to step 5.  Otherwise, 
   you need to patch the SquirrelMail source code.  Do so from 
   the html_mail directory:

  $ patch -p0 < patches/squirrelmail-1.4.2-emoticons.diff

   Make sure that you use the patch file that matches your
   SquirrelMail version.

   Note for Windows users: you can get native patch functionality
   by installing this very useful package:
   http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/

5) Then go to your config directory and run conf.pl.  Choose
   option 8 and move the plugin from the "Available Plugins"
   category to the "Installed Plugins" category.  Save and exit.

  $ cd ../../config/
  $ ./conf.pl

6) If you plan to use the HTMLArea engine with its integrated 
   spell checking mechanism, configure your server to allow 
   CGI execution in the spell checker directory and make sure 
   your Perl installation has the correct modules.  See the 
   README file for more information.



Upgrading HTML Mail Plugin
==========================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
   Here is a example for the 1.0 version of the html_mail plugin.

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -zxvf html_mail-1.0-1.4.tar.gz

2) Change into the html_mail directory, check your config.php
   file against the new version, to see if there are any new
   settings that you must add to your config.php file.

  $ diff -Nau config.php config.php.sample

   Or simply replace your config.php file with the provided sample
   and reconfigure the plugin from scratch (see step 2 under the
   installation procedure above).
