Installing The SQL Backend for SquirrelMail Calendar Plugin
===========================================================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
   Here is a example for the 1.0 version of this plugin.

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -zxvf calendar_sql_backend-1.0-2.0.tar.gz


2) Change into the calendar_sql_backend directory, copy
   config.php.sample to config.php and edit config.php,
   adjusting your database login information and any 
   other settings as needed.  Typically, only the DSN
   will need to be changed if you use the data schema 
   provided in the README file.

  $ cd calendar_sql_backend
  $ cp config.php.sample config.php
  $ vi config.php


3) Then go to your config directory and run conf.pl.
   Choose option 8 and move the plugin from the
   "Available Plugins" category to the "Installed
   Plugins" category.  Save and exit.

  $ cd ../../../config/
  $ ./conf.pl
