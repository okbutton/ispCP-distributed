    Program ........ Plugin Updates
    Version ........ 0.7
    Purpose ........ Check your currently installed plugins for updates

*******************************************************************************/


--Purpose--

    Check your currently installed plugins against the SM site to make sure
    that you are running the current version of each.  It should really help admins
    out that have a ton of plugins installed, but no time to search through the plugins
    on the SM site to see if any updates have came out.


----[ Features

    Checks your SM version
    Displays the current Stable Version
    Checks your Plugin for updates
    Gives download link and description if update is available
    If no version file is there, creates it, and tries to figure out the plugin from the 
       directory name
    Automatically checks for updates to the pluginlist.txt and defaultdir.txt file
    Can edit the version by clicking on it, so you can easily change it after updating your plugins
       or if you have an Unknown Version
    Tells you if your plugin isn't a Official Plugin (not on SM site)
    Tells you if it is being updated in CVS, or its in the Core
    COnfigurable options for displaying everything

----[ Future Changes

    Much cleaner look?  It definitely needs it!
    Will check to make sure new version works with your current version of SM??
    Make it install newer versions of the plugins???
    Connections can time out? (incase my site or SM is down?)
    
    Got any ideas or complaints, please e-mail me!
