----[ Installation

    Installation is very simple really.  If you want to change the plugin directory for installation
       just edit the update.php, setup.php, and editv.php files.
    Edit the admin.php file and put your username there (leave the #)
    As of this point, this plugin is unsupport by all the others, so you may have to add support manually
       by adding one small file to the root of each plugin directory (try looking at the one in this directory).
       This file just consists of the plugin name (has to be the same as in my pluginlist.txt file, which is the
       same name as they have on the site) and on the next line, the version number.  (It will automatically
       create this file for you now)
    Do not change the data files unless you know what your doing!!  If I update my version of the file
       your version will detect it and ask you to download it!!
    Then just edit the Unknown version to the version of your plugin.
    That is it!  No other changes are needed.  Hopefully future changes to any plugins will include this small file.
