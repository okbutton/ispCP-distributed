This plugin will provide the functionaliy necessary to allow a user
to manage their favorites list, or "bookmarks", within the Squirrelmail
interface.  I've found myself using Squirrelmail all day every day, from
several different machines, and decided it would be nice to have my
bookmarks available as well.

To install the plugin:

  1.  Change to the plugins directory.

        $ cd plugins/

  2.  Unarchive the plugin.

        $ tar -xzf /your/path/to/bookmarks-x.x.tgz

  3.  This should create a bookmarks/ directory under plugins.

	4.  You must decide what storage method (database or text file) you want
	    to use for your bookmarks:
			
			To store bookmarks in a text file, copy 'bookmarks_data_text.php'
			to 'bookmarks_data.php'.  Users' bookmarks will be stored in the
			Squirrelmail data directory, in TAB-delimited text files named
			<username>.bookmarks.
			
			To store bookmarks in a database, copy 'bookmarks_data_db.php' to
			'bookmarks_data.php'.  Edit the 'bookmarks_data.php' file, and change
			the database DSN to fit your configuration.  You also must create the
			bookmarks table (remember to grant your DSN username access to this
			table), with the following structure:
			
			Fieldname           Type     Size
			==================  =======  ===========
			username            varchar  255
			folder              text
			title               text
			url                 text
			visit_count         int      11
			last_visit          bigint   20
			
  4.  Go to the config directory and run conf.pl

        $ cd ../../config/
        $ ./conf.pl

  5.  Choose option 8 and proceed to add the new plugin following
      the instructions there.  Save and exit, and your plugin should
      be in place.
