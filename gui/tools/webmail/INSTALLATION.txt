Quick instructions for installing squirrelmail: (detailed instructions can be found at www.squirrelmail.org)

1. If you have cpanel or ssh access to your site, then just upload the .tgz file 
you downloaded from us to the directory you want nutsmail to install to. (ie /nutsmail/ or /squirrelmail/ or /webmail/ 
or to the root, pick your flavor, or create your own)

2. In cpanel you can use the filemanager to extract the contents of the archive, or if you have ssh then 
tar -xvfz FILENAME.tgz should do it.

3. If you don't have cpanel or ssh, then use winzip or winrar or some such utility to extract the archive 
contents to a directory on your pc and then upload via ftp.

4. chmod to 777 the following directories/files: (d = directory, f = file)

	(d) /data/	(775 would be better, sometimes it doesn't work though, if it doesn't, go 777)
	(f) /data/default_pref	
	(f) /plugins/virusscan/includes/virussignatures.php (optional, isn't included in recent upgrades)

	note. this is assuming you will set your data dir to be below your squirrelmail root 
    (/NUTSMAIL/data) if in the next step you choose to have your data elsewhere on your server 
    (would require you having access to directories above your site root) you'll have to make sure that 
    directory has the appropriate permissions (777).

5. edit the config/config.php file.

	following lines are of importance: (line number in parentheses for those that use a text-editor that shows line-numbers.)

	(28) $license="Enter your license number here..."; (Put your license number provided by nutsmail here)
		
	(118)	$domain = 'yourdomain.com'; (replace with your domain)

	(146)	$smtpServerAddress = 'localhost'; (usually is "mail.yourdomain.com" or something similar, 
    however this varies from host to host so if you aren't sure check with your hosting company.

	(169)	$imapServerAddress = 'localhost'; (usually it IS localhost however you may have a special setup)

	(447)	$data_dir = SM_PATH . 'data/'; (by default is so, however if you want added 'security' you could 
    consider moving it elsewhere (requires access to server filesystem) and setting an absolute path in this 
    variable (ie. $data_dir = '/path/to/your/data/dir/'; ) you would have to ensure it has the appropriate permissions (777)

	(617)	$theme_default = 38; (change to whatever skin you want the default to be. nutsmail skins start at
		#38, we've left the original squirrelmail 'themes' as they are.

	(618)	$theme_css = SM_PATH.'themes/css/XP_BlueSky.css'; (normally this should work, if however your skin 
    looks "messed up", consider changing that to: $theme_css = /nutsmail/themes/css/XP_BlueSky.css'; (assuming you've installed to /nutsmail/ 
    if you've installed to the root of your site you would of course substitute /nutsmail/ for just / making it: $theme_css = /themes/css/XP_BlueSky.css';
		
6. finished setup, go to http://www.yourdomain.com/YOURNUTSMAILPATH/ and login.
